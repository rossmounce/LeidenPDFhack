Abstract
Two new multifoliolate species of Oxalis L. (Oxalidaceae) from the Hantam Karoo region of South Africa are described
and illustrated: Oxalis carolina and O. filifoliolata. Both species occur in single populations in the extremely geophyterich area on the Bokkeveld Plateau in the Northern Cape Province. Morphological characteristics, phylogenetic position,
habitat description and conservation status of the new species are provided, in addition to a diagnostic comparison with
other phenotypically similar Cape species. Fifteen multifoliolate Oxalis species are currently recognized in South Africa,
disregarding multifoliolate varieties of otherwise trifoliolate species. A key for multifoliolate Oxalis species known from
the Bokkeveld Plateau is presented.
Key words: Cape Floristic Region, genome size, Oxalidaceae, phylogeny, South Africa, taxonomy

Introduction
With ± 200 species and many intraspecific taxa, Oxalis L. (Oxalidaceae) is the largest geophytic genus in the
Greater Cape Floristic Region of South Africa (Dreyer & Makgakga 2003). Several new species have been
described recently, including O. ericifolia Oberlander & Dreyer (2009: 242) from the Knersvlakte and O.
saltusbelli Dreyer & Roets (2009: 113), a multifoliolate species from the Bokkeveld Plateau in the Northern
Cape Province. Multifoliolate leaves are restricted to a small, but phylogenetically diverse, group of South
African Oxalis species (Oberlander et al. 2011). In his monograph of the genus in South Africa, Salter (1944)
recognized 14 multifoliolate species, 12 of which are still recognized (Dreyer & Makgakga 2003, Dreyer et al.
2010), in addition to four multifoliolate varieties of otherwise trifoliolate species. Two unusual and very
distinct multifoliolate Oxalis taxa were discovered north of Nieuwoudtville in the Northern Cape Province
during field work collecting species for cytogenetic analyses. We describe these species as O. carolina J. Suda
& Sudová and O. filifoliolata J. Suda & Krejčíková, and evaluate their systematic position based on DNA
sequence data, morphology and karyological evidence. In addition, we provide an updated key to all
multifoliolate Oxalis species reported from the Bokkeveld Plateau, to facilitate identification of this distinct
group in the geophyte-rich area.

Material and Methods
Morphological assessment
The new taxa were compared with descriptions of all known southern African species (Salter 1944, Ornduff
1973, Oliver 1993, Williamson 1999, Kumwenda et al. 2004, Dreyer et al. 2009, Oberlander et al. 2009) and
with the living collection in the Stellenbosch University Botanical Garden. All named and unnamed Oxalis
collections from the Stellenbosch University (STEU, Stellenbosch, South Africa) and Compton (NBG, Cape
Town, South Africa) herbaria were examined. Although not strictly correct, we use the term “rhizome” when
referring to the below-ground stem in order to maintain consistency with previously published taxonomic
contributions, including the monograph of South African Oxalis (Salter 1944).
DNA sequencing and molecular analysis
The nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer region (ITS; Sun et al. 1994) was sequenced for the new
taxa following the methods of Oberlander et al. (2011). By using morphological characters as a first estimate
of phylogenetic placement, we added the sequence of O. filifoliolata to the ITS matrix of the O. flava
Linnaeus (1753: 433) clade sensu Oberlander et al. (2009). Similarly, we added O. carolina to the ITS matrix
of the O. tomentosa Linnaeus f. (1782: 244) alliance sensu Dreyer et al. (2009). Previous work has shown
substantial conflict between nuclear and plastid DNA data (Oberlander et al. 2011) regarding the phylogenetic
placement of members of the O. tomentosa alliance; consequently, we also sequenced the chloroplast noncoding trnL intron, 3’ trnL exon and trnL-trnF spacer (trnL-trnL-trnF: Taberlet et al. 1991) for a taxon set
corresponding to the ITS matrix. The chosen outgroups for all analyses were O. comosa Meyer ex Harvey &
Sonder (1860: 340) and two species of the O. purpurea Linnaeus (1753: 433) clade (O. purpurea and O.
obtusa Jacquin (1794: 106)). All generated sequences were submitted to the NCBI database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (see Supplementary material). Parsimony analyses were conducted in PAUP*
v4.0b10 (Swofford 2003), using heuristic searches to find most parsimonious trees. Starting trees were
generated using random taxon addition, and 1 000 TBR branch-swapping replicates, saving up to 100 trees
per replicate. The degree of homoplasy in the data was calculated using the parsimony-based Consistency (CI)
and Retention (RI) Indices. Support levels for nodes were assessed using non-parametric bootstrap (BS: 10
000 replicates) using heuristic searches. Bayesian Inference was conducted on the same data set using
MrBayes v3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2012) under the most complex model of sequence evolution within the 95%
confidence interval as estimated by jModelTest v0.1.1 (GTR+G+I in all cases; Posada 2008). Ten million
generations in two separate analyses, sampling every 1000th generation, were run in order to ensure adequate
sampling of the posterior distribution. Convergence on the posterior was judged using MrBayes’ own
diagnostics. Posterior probabilities (PP) served as levels of support for nodes. For the two O. tomentosa
alliance matrices, incongruence between data sets was assessed using the ILD test (Farris et al. 1994), with
10 000 replicates and all uninformative characters removed.
Flow Cytometry
Genome size was estimated by propidium iodide flow cytometry using a Partec SL cytometer equipped with
532-nm, 150 mW solid state diode-pumped laser (Cobolt Samba). Sample preparation followed the simplified
two-step procedure using Otto´s buffers as described in Doležel et al. (2007) and Krejčíková et al. (2013).
Glycine max (Linnaeus) Merrill (1917: 274) 'Polanka' (2C = 2.50 pg) was selected as an internal reference
standard.

fimbriate. Fruit not seen. Seeds not seen.

FIGURE 2. Geographic distribution of Oxalis carolina (circle) and O. filifoliolata (diamond).

Diagnostic characters:—Oxalis carolina is morphologically most similar to O. tomentosa from the SW
Cape. In addition to a clear geographic gap between the distributional ranges of these two species, O. carolina
is a more robust plant, with longer petioles and fewer, but larger leaflets (mostly 9–11 compared to 10–20 in
O. tomentosa). Another distinct feature of O. carolina is the presence of recurved sepal tips (Table 1, Fig. 1).
In addition, O. tomentosa has a pubescent corolla tube, while the corolla tube of O. carolina is glabrous.
Despite morphological similarities, O. carolina can hardly be regarded as a recent autopolyploid derivative of
the diploid O. tomentosa, because their monoploid genome sizes differ by ca. 10% (1Cx-values for O.
carolina and O. tomentosa are 0.29 pg and 0.32 pg, respectively). Nonetheless, detailed molecular work is
required to accurately identify progenitors of the new species. Oxalis palmifrons T.M. Salter (1936: 161) and

O. saltusbelli are two other multifoliolate species found in the Northern Cape Province. The former is easily
recognized by very numerous leaves with more than 20 leaflets and markedly compressed petioles. The
recently described O. saltusbelli from the Nieuwoudtville area has uniquely grooved petioles, its mature
leaflets are narrower and indumentum is sparser and softer than that of O. carolina (Table 1). Other potentially
sympatric multifoliolate species (e.g., O. zeyheri Sonder in Harvey & Sonder (1860: 347)) are prominently
caulescent and thus easy to distinguish from O. carolina.
Distribution and ecology:—Oxalis carolina grows on southwest-facing slopes above the road R357
north of Nieuwoudtville, in open Hantam Karoo vegetation (Fig. 2). Other Oxalis species recorded at this
locality include O. callosa R. Knuth (1927: 15), O. flava, O. obtusa and O. suteroides T.M. Salter (1935: 116).
The slope is very stony and the long rhizome of O. carolina appears to be an adaptation to these conditions.
Bulbs are deeply-seated in loamy soil and were often found below boulders or in crevices between stones. A
regular sympatric occurrence of mosses indicates enough moisture during the growth season. Oxalis carolina
generally favours shaded microsites, sheltered either by boulders or by surrounding shrubby vegetation, and
the species is exposed to direct sunlight only occasionally and for short periods. The size of the population
was estimated at a few hundred individuals. Plants often grow aggregated into clumps. Only a small
proportion of individuals were flowering (and flowers were seldom fully open), while most plants produced
only leaves. The palmately compound leaves superficially resemble some multifoliolate Lupinus (Fabaceae)
species. Vegetative reproduction via bulbils seems to be the prevailing mode of propagation; bulbils are
especially common along the rhizome in autumn. Although it is possible that other populations of O. carolina
occur in the area, our repeated searches during 2011–2012 in localities with similar ecological conditions were
not successful.
Phenology:—The species flowers from mid-May to late June.
Phylogenetic analysis:—The ITS data set consisted of 20 taxa and 783 characters, of which 58 were
parsimony-informative. The trnL-trnL-trnF data set consisted of 20 taxa and 937 characters, of which 16 were
parsimony-informative. Parsimony analyses of ITS and trnL-trnL-trnF found 15 trees of length 221 (CI:
0.760; RI: 0.694), and 78 600 trees of length 81 (CI: 0.951; RI: 0.909), respectively. Bayesian analyses
provided 15 002 trees after burn-in (harmonic mean log likelihood ITS: -2 437.37, trnL-trnL-trnF: -1 854.72).
All diagnostics indicated that all runs for each marker had converged on the same stable posterior
distributions. Parsimony and Bayesian trees were very similar, and similar to previous analyses using these
markers (Oberlander et al. 2009, 2011, Dreyer et al. 2010). The O. tomentosa alliance is strongly supported as
a monophyletic group in the ITS data set (Fig. 3), with O. carolina and two accessions of O. palmifrons
resolving with the multifoliolate members of the alliance (PP: 1.00; BS: 98%). In contrast, O. palmifrons does
not group with the remainder of the alliance in trnL-trnL-trnF trees, and O. carolina is only weakly supported
(PP: 0.98; BS: 53%) as sister to the remaining species of the alliance. The ILD test in PAUP* showed that the
ITS and trnL-trnL-trnF data sets were barely congruent with one another (P = 0.067). Although clearly
associated with members of the O. tomentosa alliance in both analyses, neither nuclear nor plastid data
support a close relationship of O. carolina to any particular member species.
Genome size:—The mean 2C-value was estimated to be 1.16 pg, showing the new species to be
tetraploid. The amount of nuclear DNA is very different from the closest relatives of O. carolina (i.e., O.
oligophylla T.M. Salter (1938: 114), O. palmifrons, O. saltusbelli and O. tomentosa), all of which are
uniformly diploid according to flow cytometric analysis (Fig. 5B); another related species, O. hygrophila
Dreyer (2004: 262), seems to be hexaploid on the basis of genome size data.
Conservation status:—The species is known from only one very localized population consisting of a few
hundred individuals. Because the population occurs close to the road verge, it may be threatened by possible
future road construction. This species would qualify as Vulnerable under South African Red List Criteria
(Raimondo et al. 2009), due to a geographic range of less than 20 km 2 and only one known population
(Criterion D).
Etymology:—The specific epithet honours the Charles University in Prague (Universitas Carolina
Pragensis), which is the oldest university in Central Europe and Alma Mater of the first three authors.

funnel-shaped tube, conspicuously whitish-edged on outer margin beneath. Petals adhering for ± 3–5 mm to
form broadly funnel-shaped tube, oblanceolate, truncate to rounded, glabrous. Stamens 3-seriate with 2 series
per plant, the shortest 2.0–2.5 mm, the middle 3.5–4.0 mm, the longest 5.0–6.0 mm long and exserted ± 2 mm
from tube; filaments pale yellow, glabrous, edentate; pollen yellow, tricolpate, tectum reticulate, with
prominent blunt, scattered intra-luminary bacules. Ovary 1.2–1.4 mm long, ovoid, glabrous, 5-locular with 2–
3 ovules per locule; styles 5, glabrous, in three series with one series per plant, reciprocally herkogamous to
stamen series, shortest ± 2.5 mm long, middle ± 3.5 mm long, longest ± 7.0 mm long; stigmas orange,
fimbriate. Fruit not seen. Seeds not seen.

FIGURE 4. Oxalis filifoliolata. a. illustration; b. flowering individual in its natural habitat; c. pollen.

Diagnostic characters:—In its delicate habit, filiform petioles and linear leaflets, the new taxon
superficially resembles the recently described O. ericifolia. However, peduncles of the new taxon lack the
large swelling surrounding basal articulation that is characteristic of O. ericifolia, while the leaflets lack the
large papillae on the adaxial leaflet epidermis. The very short petal claws of O. ericifolia result in open,
campanulate flowers without a floral tube. This is very different to O. filifoliolata, which has much longer
claws and a well-developed floral tube. The petal claws of O. ericifolia are red, with white petal lobes, while
the claws of O. filifoliolata are greenish-yellow, the throat brick-red to brownish and the petal lobes bright
orange. The filaments of O. ericifolia are wine-red, while those of O. filifoliolata are pale yellow (Table 1).
Oxalis filifoliolata also shows numerous morphological similarities to members of the highly variable O. flava
clade (Oberlander et al. 2011), and has the same type of pollen as all members of this clade (Dreyer 1996).
Similarities between O. filifoliolata and some of the multifoliolate forms of O. flava include the acaulescent to
near acaulescent habit, glabrous leaves, distinct basal articulations on the petioles, with the petiole somewhat
dilated below this articulation, and the multifoliolate leaves with a peltate leaflet arrangement. However, O.
filifoliolata is substantially more delicate than any of the known forms of O. flava. It has dark brown outer
bulb tunics, while the bulb tunics of O. flava are usually light brown. Each leaflet has two distinct orange
apical calli, which are absent from the leaflets of O. flava. Oxalis flava usually has orange calli on its sepals,

while the sepals of the new taxon are ecallose. Flower colours known from the O. flava complex include
white, yellow and light pink, while the new taxon has orange flowers with a brick-red to brownish throat and
greenish-yellow tube. The new taxon has glabrous, edentate filaments, while the filaments of O. flava are
minutely glandular-pilose with obtuse teeth (Table 1).
Oxalis pulvinata Salter (1940: 170) is another multifoliolate member of the O. flava clade (Oberlander et
al. 2011) with filiform petioles, which occurs in the same geographic region as O. filifoliolata and may be
confused with it. Oxalis pulvinata differs from O. filifoliolata in having pale brown bulb tunics, pale rose or
yellow petals and abruptly swollen, pulvinate lower and upper petiole articulations. Both its leaflets and
sepals are ecallose, and the often blood red filaments bear distinct teeth.
Distribution and ecology:—Oxalis filifoliolata is known from a single population at Gannabos north of
Nieuwoudtville en route to Loeriesfontein (Fig. 2). The population is large, consisting of several thousand
individuals spread over approximately two kilometres along the route. It is more abundant in the lower lying
flat areas, but some individuals do occur on the slopes and even summits of the surrounding hills. The
substrate is dry and very stony. Plants usually grow in open places unassociated with surrounding vegetation
and are mostly exposed to full sun.
Phenology:—The species flowers from mid-May to late June.
Phylogenetic analysis:—The ITS data set consisted of 41 taxa and 800 characters, of which 110 were
parsimony-informative. Parsimony analyses of ITS found 353 trees of length 407 (CI: 0.568; RI: 0.657).
Bayesian analyses provided 15 002 trees after burn-in (harmonic mean log likelihood: -3 566.6). All
diagnostics indicated that both runs had converged on the same stable posterior distribution. Parsimony and
Bayesian trees were very similar to each other and to trees in previous analyses using this marker (Oberlander
et al. 2009, 2011, Dreyer et al. 2010) (Fig. 3). Although the O. flava clade is well-supported (PP: 1.00; BS:
81%), internal relationships are generally poorly resolved. The well-supported sister relationship between O.
flava and O. monophylla Linnaeus (1771: 241) is complicated here by the new taxon, which resolves as sister
to O. flava with only moderate support (PP: 0.84; BS: 68%). Although we also sequenced a non-coding
plastid marker for the new taxon (the trnS-trnG spacer), more limited sampling for the O. flava clade
compared to ITS precluded any conclusive findings beyond a well-supported relationship with two sequences
of O. flava, although further relationships within this group were unresolved (data not shown).
Genome size:—The mean 2C-value was estimated to be 0.64 pg, showing the new species to be diploid.
The monoploid genome size of O. filifoliolata is much smaller than the values determined for other members
of the O. flava clade (Fig. 5A).
Conservation status:—The species is known from only one rather large population. Due to its restricted
geographic area, O. filifoliolata deserves attention of conservation authorities. This plant would qualify as
Vulnerable under South African Red List criteria (Raimondo et al. 2009), due to a known range smaller than
20 km2 and less than five known populations (Criterion D).
Etymology:—The specific epithet refers to the long, thin leaflets.
Note:—Non-flowering and partially dry material of O. filifoliolata was first observed in the Aloe
dichotoma Masson (1776: 310) forest at Gannabos in September 2009, but was considered to be a
multifoliolate form of the superficially similar O. ericifolia. Subsequent visits in May and June 2011,
however, found the population in full flower, and the striking orange flowers clearly distinguished this species
from O. ericifolia. It is very surprising that O. filifoliolata was only discovered now, given that it grows in
sympatry with the charismatic and easily visible Aloe dichotoma. Oxalis filifoliolata produces bright orange
flowers during May/June, which coincides with the flowering time of A. dichotoma, arguably a phenomenon
that would attract many visitors to the site. The most plausible explanation for this late discovery of O.
filifoliolata is its very diminutive size, and the inconspicuous leaves and leaflets. An unusual variety of O.
flava var. unifoliolata Dreyer & Oberlander (2010: 258) was recently described from this same locality
(Dreyer et al. 2010).
