Carex Linnaeus (1753: 972) is one of the largest genera of seed plants (Frodin 2004). It comprises about 2,000
species worldwide and is easily distinguished from other genera of Cyperaceae by having perigynia enclosing
the nutlets (Reznicek 1990, Goetghebeur 1998, Govaerts et al. 2007, Mabberley 2008, Dai et al. 2010). There
are 535 species in three subgenera and 57 sections recognized in China (Dai et al. 2010, Wang et al. 2012).
Carex sect. Graciles Kükenthal (1899: 516) is characterized by the sheathed involucral bracts, two to
numerous spikes, usually one to several spikes borne in an involucral bract sheath, rarely arranged in a
compound inflorescence, the female spikes sparsely flowered, rarely slightly more densely flowered, two
stigmas, and plano-convex or biconvex utricles (Dai et al. 2010). It consists of about thirty species distributed
in tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, Australia and the Pacific islands. Twenty-one species, with thirteen
of them endemic, were recorded in China (Dai et al. 2010).
Carex henryi belongs to sect. Graciles and was reported from China and Nepal (Dai et al. 2010, Yano et
al. 2013). The name Carex henryi was originally used on herbarium specimens by Clarke in the 1880s–1890s,
but it was not formally published then. Later, it was mentioned by Franchet (1896) under the name C.
bodinieri Franchet (1896: 243). The name Carex henryi was however not accepted by Franchet, and no
description was provided. Therefore, this name was not validly published then, and the authorship should not
be attributed to “C. B. Clarke ex Franchet” as cited by the later authors (Clarke 1903, Kükenthal 1909,
Koyama 1956, Zhongguo Kexueyuan Xibei Zhiwu Yanjiusuo 1970, Instituto Botanico Boreali-Occidentali
Academiae Sinicae 1976, Institute of Botany Chinese Academy of Sciences 1976, Wang 1988, Su 1992,
Zheng 1993, Li 1994, Liang 1995, Ding & Wang 1998, Dai 2000, 2009, Fu 2002, Dai et al. 2003).
In 1903, Clarke himself validly published the name Carex longicruris Nees in Wight (1834: 124) var.
henryi Clarke (1903: 295) for this taxon and cited “C. henryi C. B. Clarke ex Franchet” as synonym. Clarke’s
treatment was accepted by some later authors (Kükenthal 1909, Handel-Mazzetti 1936, Wu 1984). But his var.
henryi differs from typical C. longicruris, which is distributed in the west Himalayan regions, in its smaller
perigynia with the less scabrous beak and looser panicles (Koyama 1956), and was recognized as a separate
species independent from C. longicruris in the recently published Chinese floras (Zhongguo Kexueyuan Xibei
Zhiwu Yanjiusuo 1970, Instituto Botanico Boreali-Occidentali Academiae Siniacae 1976, Institute of Botany
Chinese Academy of Sciences 1976, Wang 1988, Su 1992, Zheng 1993, Li 1994, Liang 1995, Ding & Wang
1998, Dai 2000, 2009, Fu 2002, Dai et al. 2003, 2010).
Dai et al. (2010) noticed for the first time that the name C. henryi was not validated by Franchet (1896),
and they treated it as being validated by Dai (2000) through full and direct reference to Clarke’s C. longicruris
var. henryi. When Yano et al. (2013) reported the new record of Carex henryi for Nepal, they were aware of
that the first use of the name C. henryi in Chinese floras was in the Flora Tsinlingensis (Zhongguo Kexueyuan
Xibei Zhiwu Yanjiusuo 1970, Instituto Botanico Boreali-Occidentali Academiae Sinicae 1976), where the
authorship of Carex henryi was also cited as “C. B. Clarke ex Franch.” with full and direct reference to C.
longicruris var. henryi, and they therefore presumed that the name C. henryi was validated in this publication.
Though no author of Cyperaceae was indicated in the flora, Yano et al. (2013) ascribed the authorship to “K.
T. Fu” who is the author of the new species of Carex described in Flora Tsinlingensis.

However, both Dai et al. (2010) and Yano et al. (2013) overlooked that Koyama (1956) was the first to
validly publish the name Carex henryi when he recognized it as an independent species. It is true that Koyama
(1956) did not cite the correct publication of the basionym and cited “Carex longicruris Nees var. henryi (C.
B. Clarke ex Franch.) Kükenth. in Engl., Pflanzenr. 4–20: 603 (1909)” as basionym, but Koyama provided a
Latin description for the name C. henryi that fulfilled the conditions of valid publication of names of new taxa
(ICN Art. 38–40, McNeill et al. 2012). According to Article 41.8(d) of the ICN (McNeill et al. 2012), the
citation errors of Koyama can be corrected, and accordingly, a new combination Carex henryi (C. B. Clarke)
Koyama was validly published by Koyama (1956), otherwise a new species was validly published by him.
The correct author and the place of valid publication of Carex henryi are corrected below.

Carex henryi (C. B. Clarke) Koyama (1956: 175)
Basionym: Carex longicruris var. henryi Clarke (1903: 295). Lectotype (designated by Yano et al. 2013: 144):—CHINA.
