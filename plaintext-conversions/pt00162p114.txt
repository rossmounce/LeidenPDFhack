With the description of Carex infirminervia Naczi (in Naczi et al. 2002: 528) and the summation of Carex sect.
Deweyanae (Tuckerman ex Mackenzie 1913: 352) Mackenzie (1931: 114) by Naczi (in Naczi 2002: 321–325), a
recent summary of Pacific Northwest sedges (Wilson et al. 2008: 106–107), and the new Jepson Manual (Zika et
al. 2012: 1322), the circumscription of C. bolanderi Olney (1868: 393) is now firmly established. As such, C.
bolanderi occurs from southern British Columbia to southern California east to Montana, Utah and New Mexico,
and then south in the Sierra Madre Occidental through Chihuahua to northern Durango, Mexico. Previous usage of
C. bolanderi was somewhat confused both as to its circumscription and to its distribution because of the inclusion
of some specimens of C. infirminervia as in the cases of Munz (1959: 1443, 1974: 887) and Mastrogiuseppe (1993:
1122), or when it was included in C. deweyana Schweinitz (1824: 65; e.g., Cronquist 1969: 261, 1977: 158, Taylor
1983: 102).
Olney (1868: 393) cited four collections when he proposed Carex bolanderi. Errors are present in the citation
of the first two of these syntypes (Brewer 1665, Hillebrand 2313, Bolander 6201, and Bolander 6209). Brewer
1665 does not exist among the C. bolanderi specimens in Olney’s herbarium (BRU) or in the other herbaria we
examined. Rather, the correct number is Brewer 1655 (BRU!, DS [2]!, GH!, MO!, NY!, UC!, US). Similarly, the
correct number for the second syntype is 2315 (BRU!, GH!, UC!, US). The latter correction was noted by
Mackenzie (1921a: 37). However, the collector’s name on the label of 2315 at BRU is “Brewer” whereas
“Hillebrand” is credited with the collections at GH and UC. Based on information in extant field books, the
collector of the latter is Wilhelm B. Hillebrand rather than William H. Brewer.
By selecting one of the four Olney syntypes, Mackenzie (1921a: 37) declared a step-1 lectotype when he wrote
“Bolander 6209 from the Yosemite is taken as the type.” Designation of Bolander 6209 as the type subsequently
was repeated by Mackenzie (1921b: 218, 1931: 117). At least three duplicates of Bolander 6209 exist (at BRU!,
GH!, UC!). Our examination of this gathering has shown that important morphological details mentioned in the
original description are not borne out in Bolander 6209. Olney described the perigynia as nerved and with spongy
bases (“perigyniis ovalibus vel ellipticis acuminato-rostratis bifidis plano-convexis margine acutis serratis nervatis
basi spongiosis squama ovata hispida aristata albo-hyalina nervo viridi longioribus”), and the achenes as orbicular
or ovate (“achenio orbiculato vel ovato”). On Bolander 6209, the perigynia, being immature, lack nerves and
spongy bases. In addition, the achenes are not developed. In contrast, Bolander 6201 possesses perigynia with 3–6
complete nerves on their abaxial surfaces and has perigynia with spongy bases. Also, the achenes on Bolander
6201 are orbicular-ovate. Examining the entirety of Olney’s detailed description, it is clear that Olney compiled his
comments from most if not all of his syntypes and Mackenzie failed to examine the syntypes carefully before
making a step-1 lectotypification. Furthermore, considering Olney’s English diagnosis that differentiated C.
bolanderi from C. deweyana, his emphasis of “the oval or elliptical and nerved perigyna” as being critical to the
identification of his new species further removes Bolander 6209 as a reasonable choice for a type as these features
are not present. Mackenzie (1921a: 37) assigned Bolander 6201 to C. leptopoda Mackenzie (1917: 124, 1060), but
this was a misidentification. Our examination of Bolander 6201 has shown the perigynium beaks are 41–48% of
the perigynium lengths, and this feature unambiguously distinguishes that collection from C. leptopoda, which has
perigynium beaks 28–38% of the perigynium lengths.

Bolander 6209 lacks the characters considered to be critical by Olney to distinguish his new species and is so
young that even now the collection cannot be assigned to any one of the species assigned to sect. Deweyanae.
Thus, Bolander 6209 “is demonstrably ambiguous and cannot be critically identified for purposes of the precise
application of the name to a taxon” (Art. 9.8; McNeill et al. 2012). However, because a syntype cannot be
considered to be in conflict with the protologue (Art. 9.19; McNeill et al. 2012), Mackenzie’s step-1 lectotype
collection, Bolander 6209, cannot be rejected under 9.19(b) of that article. Therefore, we (1) designate the BRU
specimen as a necessary step-2 lectotypification (Art. 9.17), and (2) designate Bolander 6201 as an epitype to allow
the continued use of C. bolanderi as currently circumscribed (Fig. 1).

Carex bolanderi Olney (1868: 393)
Lectotypus (step-1, Mackenzie 1921a: 37):—UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. California: [Mariposa Co., Big Trees],
Yosemite [National Park], 1866, H.N. Bolander 6209 (lectotypus [step-2, hic designatus]: BRU!, isolectotypi: GH!, UC!,
US).
Epitypus (hic designatus):—UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. California: [Mariposa Co.], Yosemite Valley, 1866, H.N.
Bolander 6201 (BRU!, isoepitypi: CAS!, DS!, G [2], GH!, MICH!, MO [2]!, NY [2]!, UC [2]!, US [2], VT!, YU [2]).

Should it be demonstrated via future studies that Bolander 6209 differs taxonomically from our proposed epitype,
Bolander 6201, the epitype would nevertheless maintain its standing unless and until it is displaced by
a conservation proposal (Art. 9.20; McNeill et al. 2012).

be “in conflict with the protologue”. We thank Johanna Schmitt and Kathleen McCauley for lending Olney's
