Abstract
Changes in diatom abundance and cell size in Great Lakes phytoplankton collections were examined from two periods,
1996–1999 and 2007–2008. Trends indicate marked shifts in pelagic diatoms, including diatom total biovolume and cell
density declines. Concurrent with these changes have been establishments of invasive species, water quality changes and
longer stratification periods resulting from climate warming. No consistent change in cell sizes was observed in diatoms
between the two periods in the Great Lakes basin as a whole, but lake- and taxon-specific changes were apparent. Cell
size declines include centric and pennate diatoms in the spring in Lake Huron and pennate diatoms in the spring in Lake
Superior. Increases in cell size occurred for centric diatoms in Lake Erie and pennate diatoms in the summer in lakes
Michigan and Ontario. Some of the more dominant taxa exhibited lake-specific shifts. For instance, lightly-silicified
diatoms such as Nitzschia increased in length in Lake Huron, possibly as an adaptation to climate warming and/or
declining nutrient supplies. Difficulty in explaining the observed changes in cell sizes is acknowledged, but continued
study of these trends is critical to understanding impacts on Great Lakes food webs.

Introduction
Phytoplankton size structures are influenced by environmental drivers such as nutrients, thermal structure of
the water column and grazing (Parsons & Takahashi 1973). For example, high nutrient concentrations often
result in a shift to larger-celled algal assemblages (Watson & Kalff 1981, Peters 1983, Sprules & Munawar
1986). Physiological models generally predict that the proportion of smaller cells in an assemblage will
increase with decreasing nutrient availability (Irwin et al. 2006). In most related literature this is considered
logical because nutrient (and light) acquisition is maximized at high surface area/volume ratios (i.e., small
sizes) (Finkel et al. 2004). Alternatively, it has also been hypothesized that diatom size decreases in response
to increasing nutrients in order to slow the rate of sinking out of the euphotic zone as would be needed if the
depth of light penetration decreased with increasing biological content of the epilimnion (Smol et al. 1984).
It has been postulated that size-dependent sinking would be constrained by stratification regimes
(Rodríguez et al. 2001; Winder et al. 2009), and so cell sizes and shapes may adjust in response to climate
shifts such as warming. Climate influences have been noted to have simultaneous influences on taxonomic
composition and cell sizes in diatom communities. Over the period of recent warming, arctic (Smol et al.
2005) and temperate lakes in Europe and North America (Rühland et al. 2008) have manifested a distinct shift
towards smaller planktonic diatom species, especially those in the genus Cyclotella (Kützing) de Brébisson
(1838: 19). Finkel et al. (2009) noted that the median size of diatoms decreased in a comparison of preEuropean and modern sedimentary assemblages of diatoms from a suite of alkaline Ontario lakes. The
apparent selection of small species was linked to climate-induced increases in the duration and strength of the

stratification period. In agreement, a reduction in diatom size in Lake Tahoe has been linked to climateinduced strengthening of summer stratification (Winder et al. 2009).
Size ranges of phytoplankton consumed by grazers are limited by grazer morphology (Burns 1968, Geller
& Muller 1981, Bogdan & Gilbert 1984), particularly in the case of filter-feeding cladocerans, and also by
size-selective feeding by copepods (Wilson 1973). Therefore, changes in the composition of the herbivore
community can impact size distributions of phytoplankton. Sommer et al. (2001) have shown differential
effects of cladocerans and copepods on the size structure of phytoplankton communities. This is particularly
relevant given the dramatic shifts in cladoceran/copepod ratios that have been observed recently in some of
the Great Lakes (Barbiero et al. 2009a, 2009b). Shifts in algal cell sizes have generally been observed as shifts
in the assemblage; i.e., a change in species composition in response to a change in environmental conditions.
However, little is known about intra-species changes in algal cell size, with the rare exception of herbivorealgae studies. Some algal species are able to adjust their phenotype (e.g., spines, size) in response to grazing.
For instance, grazing pressure has been known to result in changes in the shape and size of certain algae, such
as Scenedesmus Meyen (1829: 774) (Hessen & Van Donk 1993), but similar evaluations for diatoms have
been rare (e.g., Pondaven et al. 2007).
The planktonic communities of the Laurentian Great Lakes have been subject to environmental changes
in the past several decades that might have an impact on diatom cell size. Successful implementation of
phosphorus controls in response to the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement has resulted in a decrease in
nutrient concentrations in many regions of the lakes (Johengen et al. 1994, Dolan & McGunagle 2005). This
trend towards oligotrophication has accelerated in recent years, perhaps driven by the appearance of
dreissenid mussels (Barbiero et al. 2009a, 2009b, Dove 2009, Fahnenstiel et al. 2010). These more recent
reductions in nutrients have been accompanied by sometimes dramatic shifts in zooplankton communities.
For example, the cladoceran community of Lake Huron has virtually disappeared since 2003 (Barbiero et al.
2009a), while similar, if not quite as dramatic, changes have occurred in Lake Michigan at roughly the same
time (Kerfoot et al. 2010). There is also recent evidence that climate change has resulted in warming of the
Great Lakes and an increase in the period of stratification (e.g., Austin & Coleman 2008, Dobiesz et al. 2009,
Trumpickas et al. 2009).
While some of the effects of these changes on diatom communities have already been documented (e.g.,
Barbiero et al. 2006), much remains unknown about the impacts of recent climate warming, changes in
nutrient flux (increases and decreases), herbivore shifts and other stressors on the Great Lakes pelagic system.
A cursory analysis of the Great Lakes phytoplankton from the last 15 years reveals declines in cell numbers
and biovolume (with the exception of Lake Erie), concurrent with rapid changes in water quality (Osantowski
2010) and other biological communities [zooplankton (Barbiero et al. 2009a), the benthic macroinvertebrate
Diporeia (Nalepa et al. 2009)]. In some cases these changes are attributed to establishment of invasive
species, such as the quagga mussel which has carpeted the entire Lake Michigan basin (Bunnell et al. 2009),
likely resulting in dramatic reductions in microorganism biomass. However, changes in the planktonic
community, especially those that probably reflect trophic relationships, are not always so easily explained.
A better understanding of the shifts in the Great Lakes phytoplankton is needed to explain past changes in
environmental condition, but more importantly to determine future scenarios. The recent, rapid shifts in water
quality and biological assemblages are worrisome, and explanations of likely causal factors will be critical to
management recommendations. Evaluating changes in diatom assemblages and cell sizes, and comparing
these changes with shifts observed in other freshwater lakes, can reveal drivers and trajectories of pelagic
condition as they relate to primary producers. Furthermore, future applications of diatom size in sedimentary
records could be a useful indicator of ecological change (e.g., warming; Winder et al. 2009) in response to
changes in a lake’s condition.
Since 1983 the USEPA’s Great Lakes National Program Office (GLNPO) has undertaken an annual
monitoring program for the pelagic Great Lakes. To meet goals of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement
of 1978 (USEPA 1997), the monitoring program collects environmental information that is important to
understanding the Great Lakes food chain. The primary objective of the annual program is to assess the

environmental quality in the open lake basins. Phytoplankton collections are followed by identification and
enumeration of diatoms and non-diatomaceous algae. Ultimately these algae data are evaluated for long-term
trends in phytoplankton as they relate to stressors and food web dynamics. We quantified the abundance,
taxonomic composition and size of diatoms from the Great Lakes phytoplankton collections from two
periods; a pre-2000 (1996–1999) and recent (2007–2008) period. Primary aims of this examination of 13-year
trends from the pelagic Great Lakes were to substantiate trends in diatom (1) density and biovolume, (2) cell
sizes, and (3) assemblage composition. From these trends we affirm the main changes taking place and
hypothesize driving influences.

Methods
Twice yearly the U.S. EPA conducts surveillance monitoring of the offshore waters of the Great Lakes to
fulfill provisions of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. To track environmental conditions and trends
these surveys include phytoplankton collections (Barbiero & Tuchman 2002), and detailed diatom
assessments are performed on these samples. The diatom samples in this investigation comprise pelagic
collections from spring and summer cruises of the R/V Peter Wise Lake Guardian in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2007
and 2008. Integrated phytoplankton samples were created from a composite of water samples taken at discrete
depths with a rosette sampler. For an unstratified water column (early spring), the integrated sample was
prepared by taking equal volumes of water from depths of 1, 5, 10 and 20 meters unless the depth was less
than 20 meters. For epilimnetic sampling of a stratified water column (summer), equal volumes were taken
from 1 m, 5 m, 10 m and the lower epilimnion. Aliquots from each depth were combined to form a 1-L
composite sample which was preserved with 10 mL each of Lugol’s Solution and 37% formalin.
Sample preparation
At least 500 mL of sample water were digested in a 1000 mL beaker using 20 mL of concentrated HNO3.
Beakers were heated at approximately 100 ºC (steaming or barely boiling) on a hotplate until the volume was
reduced to about 20 mL. In a 300 mL beaker the remaining water was combined with 25 mL of 30% H2O2 and
a few crystal grains of K2Cr2O7. Samples were re-heated until the volume was reduced to less than 10 mL.
Samples were transferred to 15-mL graduated centrifuge tubes and rinsed at least seven times with deionized
water as follows: Samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes; all but 0.5 mL of supernatant was
were drawn off; deionized water was added to bring the volume up to at least 10 mL; and the sample was
agitated using a vortex mixer. On final centrifugation all but 0.5 mL of supernatant was drawn off and the final
slurry volume was brought up to 5 mL with deionized water.
Two microscope slides were made from each sample. Round coverslips were placed on a static-free slide
warmer. A homogenized 0.25 mL aliquot of slurry was added to each coverslip and allowed to dry. Heating of
the slides was never applied because it resulted in clumping of the diatom remains, so coverslips were allowed
to dry at room temperature. Diatom density was observed at 200x magnification under a compound
microscope to ensure adequate diatom density for counting. If needed, additional slurry was added and dried.
Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides using Hyrax® medium.
Sample analysis
Diatoms were identified and enumerated at 1000–1250x using oil immersion. Identification to the lowest
taxonomic rank was facilitated using standard references (a full list of the taxonomic literature used is
available from the primary author). At least 500 valves were counted per slide. At least 10 specimens of each
taxon were measured for cell volume calculations. When fewer than 10 specimens were present, those present
were measured as they were encountered. Measurements for each specimen were recorded as one or more of
length, width, diameter and depth. For many taxa (such as Stephanodiscus Ehrenberg (1845: 72) and
Cyclotella), depth measurements were problematic because the cells were seldom oriented in girdle view. For

biovolume calculations, when a certain dimension for a specimen could not be measured the average for that
taxon was assumed based on measurements from previous years. Cell size as presented in the results refers to
the most relevant measured dimension for a given taxon. For instance, because they were typically oriented in
valve view the most frequent available measurement for Cyclotella stelligera (Cleve & Grunow in Cleve) Van
Heurck (1882: pl. 94, fig. 22–26) was valve diameter, whereas for the pennate diatom Fragilaria crotonensis
Kitton (1869: 110) the valve length was almost always measured. Taxa such as Aulacoseira Thwaites (1848:
167) were typically oriented in girdle view, so valve depth was the dominant measurement.
Densities of diatom cells (cells mL-1) were based on quantitative counts of centric and pennate diatoms
recorded during detailed assessment of the non-diatomaceous algae (USEPA 2010). Biovolumes of cells (µm3
mL-1) were calculated based on formulas representing the closest approximation of each diatom’s geometric
shape. A list of the geometric forms and formulae are listed in Chapter 4 of the USEPA’s standard operating
procedures for the monitoring effort (USEPA 2010). For this article, calculations were used to estimate algal
biovolume per unit water volume for all diatoms encountered in a given sample, centric diatoms and pennate
diatoms. Pre- and post-2000 analyses were performed by different algal analysts. Although taxonomic workshops
were held for consistency we cannot fully discount an analytical artifact on algal abundance estimates.
To evaluate changes over the sampling period, monitoring data (cell dimensions, densities and
biovolumes) were averaged for each of the pre- (three years) and post-2000 (two years) periods. Differences
in these parameters between the two periods were used to graphically track changes. Significance of changes
was determined using the R programming language (version 2.10.0, R Development Core Team 2010) with
the R Commander package (version 1.5-6, Fox 2005).

Results
Diatom abundance
The dominant difference in Great Lakes diatoms between the two periods was a decline in assemblage density
and biovolume, with spring assemblages exhibiting the most obvious unidirectional differences (Fig. 1).
Spring data show consistent declines in both density and biovolume in the upper lakes (Superior, Huron,
Michigan) and declines in biovolume in Lake Ontario. Increases in spring diatoms in Lake Erie are attributed
to substantial recent blooms of the large-celled centric diatom Aulacoseira islandica (O.Müller) Simonsen
(1979: 60), especially in the central basin. Trends in summer abundance varied by sample location. In the
summer, diatom densities and biovolume in central to northern Lake Huron and southern locations in lake
Superior predominantly declined, density and biovolume increased in northern Lake Superior, and biovolume
declined in central lake Erie while densities increased. Otherwise there was little evidence of lake-wide
summer trends for the other lakes. While not presented here, it is worth noting that other algal forms
(chrysophytes, cryptophytes, chlorophytes and cyanophytes) largely exhibited a similar summer change as the
diatoms over the study period (unpublished data).
Are cells getting smaller or larger?
By constraining size-based analyses to taxa that occurred in both the pre- and post-2000 assemblages we
factored out the influence of assemblage shifts over time and examined whether average cell sizes were
collectively changing across the individual taxa (Fig. 2). Overall, the first two columns of scatterplots in Fig.
2 indicate no consistent change in taxon-specific cell sizes. Applying a paired test on taxon-specific
differences in each lake for each season revealed no overall change in cell sizes (Wilcoxon paired tests with
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, P = 0.05). Points that lie farther from the 1:1 line indicate that
some taxa may have changed size, but in general these taxa tended to be less common and so may not
accurately represent their populations. For instance, the average length of Amphipleura pellucida (Kützing)
Kützing (1844: 103) (Fig. 2) may have decreased, but this taxon was not commonly observed in
phytoplankton samples. More detailed investigation into taxon-specific changes in Lake Erie indicated that

the abundant taxon Aulacoseira islandica (an increase from 18 to 21 µm average mantle depth), among
others, has increased in average size. Similar shifts were not reflected in most other taxa. A comparison of
boxplots indicates no overall change in cell sizes when sizes were averaged within taxa and across both
seasons (Fig. 2, third column).

Great Lakes. Lines represent the difference in diatom abundance (density or biovolume) between the average for pre-2000 years (1996,

each sample location. Gray, up-pointing lines similarly indicate density or biovolume increases over the sampling period.

Examination of the site-specific changes in cell size for total diatoms, centrics and pennates (Fig. 3)
reveals no consistent pattern across the Great Lakes. In the spring, cell size decreases are noted in Lake
Huron, western Lake Erie and eastern Lake Ontario; these size reductions are largely attributed to the pennate
diatoms. In Lake Erie, spring cell sizes increased in the central and eastern basins, mostly due to the dominant
Aulacoseira islandica. Spring size changes in Lake Superior have no discernable spatial pattern overall, but
pennate diatoms may be decreasing in size. Similarly for summer, no Great Lakes basin-wide pattern in size
changes were apparent. However, lake-specific changes suggest that summer cells are getting smaller in
northern Lake Huron (pennates) and central and eastern Lake Erie (centrics and pennates). Summer size
increases are apparent in Lake Michigan (mostly pennate diatoms), and Lake Ontario (mostly pennates).
Space limitations prevent inclusion of trend data for all of the common Great Lakes taxa, but trends in cell
sizes for some of the species that contribute substantial algal biovolume to the lakes are presented in Fig. 4
(similar plots for all common taxa are available from the primary author). Certain taxa, such as large
Stephanodiscus, have notably decreased in size in some of the lakes, whereas many of the thin, narrowlanceolate or rod-shaped taxa (e.g., Nitzschia Hassall (1845: 435) and Asterionella formosa Hassall (1850:
10)) have become longer. As an example, Nitzschia acicularis (Kützing) W. Smith (1853: 43), a common
diatom in Lake Superior in spring and summer, has increased in length by an average of 27 µm in that lake.

Discussion
With the exception of Lake Erie, recent declines in the density and biovolume of diatoms have occurred in the
Great Lakes basin. Lake- and taxon-specific changes in cell sizes were also observed for the study period.
These changes in the diatoms are attributed to some known changes in environmental condition, but in many
cases it has been difficult to confirm reasons for the observed shifts.
Despite substantial changes in physical, chemical and biological conditions in the Great Lakes over the
13-year study period, no consistent shift in diatom sizes has occurred across all taxa. While shifts to smaller
diatoms have been the norm in lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere (Rühland et al. 2008), a similar
trend does not appear to apply to the recent history of the Great Lakes, likely owing to the significant
physicochemical differences between the Great Lakes and the smaller lakes used in the paleoecological data
summary of Rühland et al. To understand the observed trends it is clear that the Great Lakes need to be
considered individually, and in cases like Lake Erie there are obvious spatial differences among sub-basins.
There has been a distinct shift to smaller taxa in Lake Huron, particularly in spring assemblages. Closer
examination of taxonomic shifts reveals that large-celled taxa such as Stephanodiscus subtransylvanicus
Gasse (1980: 47–48) have been replaced by smaller-celled taxa including Cyclotella cf. atomus Hustedt
(1937: 143). Lake Huron has undergone the most dramatic ecological changes between the two periods
compared in our study. These include the crash of cladoceran populations in the offshore of the lake (Barbiero
et al. 2009a) and the collapse of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus Wilson), previously the main prey fish in the
lake (Riley et al. 2008), both in 2003. That same year saw an abrupt decline in the magnitude of the spring
algal bloom, according to higher water clarity (Barbiero et al. 2011). During the study period Huron has
simultaneously experienced declines in nutrients (Barbiero 2009a) and overall algal biomass (Barbiero et al.
2011), factors that may be related to the establishment of the quagga mussel (Nalepa et al. 2007). Similar
chemical and biological trends have been observed in Lake Michigan (Fahnenstiel et al. 2010), but Michigan
experienced an average increase in the length of pennate diatoms. It may be that, due to the rapid expansion of
the filter-feeding quagga mussel throughout the Michigan basin between the two periods investigated in our
study (Nalepa et al. 2009), the diatoms, albeit lower in number, are becoming larger as smaller cells are
selectively grazed. It is unclear, though, whether such shifts would be manifested at the species level, as
opposed to the community level.
In general it appears that, as Huron became more oligotrophic, large, heavy diatoms such as Aulacoseira
islandica and Stephanodiscus subtransylvanicus decreased in size while needle-like taxa, such as Nitzschia
acicularis and Asterionella formosa, became longer. Such a change might suggest adaptation of needle-like
cells to increase surface area for nutrient absorption in an increasingly limited environment. Increasing in
length is also considered an adaptation to reduce sinking rates (Hutchinson 1967), which may be a result of a
longer ice-free season and stronger late-summer stratification (higher epilimnetic temperatures and greater
density differential in the thermocline; King et al. 1997).
Although dreissenids appear to be a driving force behind algal declines in Lake Michigan (Vanderploeg et
al. 2010), some of the changes in diatom assemblage composition and cell sizes in the other lakes are
probably not explainable by grazing pressure. Lake Huron has a smaller dreissenid population (Nalepa et al.
2007) and has seen substantial declines in zooplankton, yet algal densities are also declining (Barbiero et al.
2011). In Lake Superior there is no known change in herbivores that could account for the observed spring
declines in cell density and biovolume. This decrease in Huron and Superior’s algal density and biovolume
may be associated with warming climate, which has reduced the average period and extent of ice cover,
increased average annual surface water temperatures and extended the annual stratification period (e.g.,
Austin & Coleman 2008). Similar phenomena on other large lakes, such as Lake Tahoe (Winder et al. 2009),
resulted in a decrease in the median size of diatoms as an adaptation to reduce sinking velocity. A similar
overall change in cell sizes did not occur in Lake Superior, but certain taxa have had clear unidirectional shifts
in cell size; some taxa have decreased (e.g., Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg) or increased (e.g., Nitzschia
acicularis) in size. Physical and chemical changes in the lake are probably affecting these changes, but

additional work is needed to better understand mechanisms. Despite an increase in average surface water
temperature it may be that there has not been sufficient time to monitor or observe class-wide changes in
diatom cell size in Lake Superior as a result of warming (note that reductions in the size of diatoms observed
by Rühland et al. [2008] were derived from paleoecological records covering a period of more than 100
years.) Concurrent changes in water quality, such as nutrients (Chapra et al. 2009), are probably limiting
planktonic assemblages, but adaptational explanations for these changes are only speculative at this time.
While diatom biovolume and densities predominantly declined across the Great Lakes basin, recent
phytoplankton collections from Lake Erie indicate increased diatom production. Most notable is the
predictable spring bloom of Aulacoseira islandica. The dominance of this taxon contributes to the increase in
average cell size in the assemblage, especially in Erie’s central basin. This change further supports the
premise that eutrophication may lead to larger cells (Winder et al. 2009), particularly in a well-mixed,
enriched lake such as Erie. However there are contrasting views in the published literature, such as Stoermer
et al. (1989), who noted in Lake Ontario that the diatom Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg (1845: 80)
decreased in diameter following eutrophication and an apparent prevention of sexual reproduction in the
species. Further, Stoermer et al. (1985) determined that eutrophication and resulting silica depletion caused
specimens of Melosira (Aulacoseira) islandica to become more finely-structured in more recent sediments of
a Lake Ontario core. The paleoecological data reflect size changes within particular taxa caused by
environmental drivers. Such unidirectional, taxon-specific changes were not as obvious in our 13-year
analyses. Based on inter-lake differences, a given taxon could increase or decrease in size based on each lake’s
unique and complex interaction of environmental factors. Even though there have been significant
environmental and assemblage changes over our study period, changes in nutrients and silica do not appear to
be having consistent impact on cell sizes within taxa.
Reasons for the augmentation of these spring diatom blooms are uncertain at this time. Nutrient trends
suggest that individual nutrient concentrations have not changed significantly in the last decade, although the
central and eastern basins of Lake Erie are the only pelagic regions in the Great Lakes with a declining N:P
ratio (USEPA, unpublished data). The success of Aulacoseira in Lake Erie may be a competitive response to
this changing ratio, so nutrient ratios may be worth additional exploration.
Study of changes in the size and shape of specific organisms in response to environmental influences has
been performed largely on higher trophic levels (e.g., cladoceran morphological responses to predation
pressure; Chang & Hanazato 2003). This analysis of Great Lakes diatoms indicates that some algal taxa may
also respond to environmental cues by changing size. However, the predominant shift in sizes, where
detectable, is attributed to temporal shifts in the taxa comprising each lake’s assemblage. Long-term changes
in Great Lakes phytoplanktonic algal assemblages have been documented previously using fossil material
(e.g., Stoermer 1993), and it is recommended that further paleoecological investigations be used to clarify
long-term, size-related changes in the algal communities.
Biotic and abiotic factors are determining the size structure in diatom communities in the Great Lakes,
and the relative effects of these factors vary by lake. These lake-specific considerations will be important in
future tracking of diatom-based trends, especially in paleoecological and other applications that require longterm information on environmental quality and food web dynamics.
