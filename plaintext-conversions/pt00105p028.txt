Thismia Griffith (1844: 221) usually grows among leaf litter in shady wet forests and comprises 47 small
mycoheterotrophic species (Chiang & Hsieh 2011, Mancinelli et al. 2012). Individual plants live underground
through most of the year, only emerging briefly to flower and fruit after periods of heavy rain (Ho et al. 2009).
Although several species have been described in temperate regions, Thismia occurs mainly in tropical
portions of America and Asia.
Thismia has been typically classified in tribe Thismieae within Burmanniaceae (e.g., Jonker 1938, Maas
et al. 1986, APG III 2009). However, recent molecular phylogenetic research has indicated that Thismia is
sister to Tacca Forster & Forster (1775: 69) and is not nested within the clade of Burmanniaceae, which
therefore supports recognition of Thismiaceae (Merckx et al. 2006).
Two detailed treatments of Thismia have been published before. Jonker (1938) recognized 23 species
within this genus and subdivided it into five sections. The second one, for Neotropical members by Maas et al.
(1986), proposed a new subgeneric and sectional classification for Thismia, that is, three sections within
subgenus Ophiomeris (Miers, 1847: 328) Maas & Maas (1986: 144) characterized by free stamens, united
thecae and parietal placentas, and one section (Rodwaya (Schlechter, 1921: 38) Maas & Maas (1986: 166))
within subgenus Thismia characterized by united staminal tube, separate thecae and free placental columns.
The genera Glaziocharis Taubert (1895: 66), Mamorea de la Sota (1960: 43) and Triscyphus Taubert (1895:
66) were included in section Pyramidalis Maas & Maas (1986: 161).
Eleven species of Thismia have been recorded in the adjacent regions of southwestern China, Vietnam,
Thailand and Burma. Three of them, T. taiwanensis Yang, Saunders & Hsu (2002: 485), T. huangii Jiang &
Hsieh (2011: 138) and T. tentaculata Larsen & Averyanov (2007: 16), are found in China. Based on
morphological studies of dry and living material, as well as field observations, a new species is named and
described for this region.
Thismia gongshanensis Hong-Qing Li & Yu-Ke Bi, sp. nov. (Fig. 1–2)
Type:—CHINA. Yunnan: Maku Village, Dulongjiang Town, Gongshan County, 2,275 m, 27o41’54.6”N, 98o18’15.62”E,
27 June 2008, Li 2008128 (holotype HSNU!; isotype KUN!).
Thismia gongshanensis most closely resembles T. tuberculata Hatusima (1976: 4), but differs in having a yellow
perianth, free stamens, bicarpelate parietal placentas and 2 simple stigmas.

Herbs with rhizome creeping horizontally, branched, terete, pale brownish, apex whitish, with adventitious
roots and buds. Stem white, unbranched, erect, glabrous, ca. 6–10 cm high, 1.8 mm in diameter at anthesis.
Leaves 4–7, translucent-whitish, elliptic-lanceolate, alternately scattered along stem, adnate, appressed,
entire, scale-like, ca. 4–7 × 2–3 mm, with a single vascular trace, apex obtuse. Bracts 3, ringed, similar to
leaves. Flower solitary with 1 mm pedicel. Perianth actinomorphic, 6 lobes in 2 whorls, fused to form a basa

tube, which is translucent-yellow, urceolate, densely tuberculate externally, 7.5 mm long, 6.5 mm in diameter,
with 12 vertical ribs on the inside of the tuber; upper part of the tube forming a bright yellow annulus (3.6 mm
outer diameter); outer (smaller) perianth lobes dark yellow, wide-triangular, 2.2 mm long (excluding
appendage) and 2.5 mm wide, radiating outward, with revolute margins, clasping subulate appendages,
translucent-white, 7–11 mm long, abaxially; inner perianth lobes yellow, wide-spathulate, 4.5 × 4.0 mm,
upper part suborbicular, apically imbricate, arching inward distally and forming a mitre over the perianth
chamber, dorsal keel ending in an erect subulate appendage (translucent-yellowish, 10–15 mm long). Stamens
6, 3.4 mm long, hanging down from the inner margin of the annulus separately; filaments yellow, flattened,
1.7 × 0.7 mm; connective elongate, white, apex recurved towards the wall of perianth tube, with a few hairs;
individual stamen with two thecae, 1.2 mm long, adaxial, thecae separate. Ovary inferior, obconical, 3.3 mm
long, 3.8 mm in diameter; carpels 2, unilocular with two parietal placentas, ovule numerous; style yellowish,
cylindrical, hollow, 1.1 mm long, 0.6 mm in diameter; stigmas 2, simple, triangular, yellowish with white
apex, 1.8 × 1.4 mm, with abaxial pubescence and basal yellow glands. Fruit and seed not seen.
Distribution:—Known only from the type locality at Maku Village, Dulongjiang Town, Gongshan
County, Yunnan Province, China.
Ecology:—This species grows among leaf litter in shady wet bamboo forest. The dominant species is
Chimonobambusa Makino (Poaceae). Other accompanying species include: members of genera
Aeschynanthus Jack (Gesneriaceae), Agapetes D.Don ex G.Don (Ericaceae), Amomum Roxb. (Zingiberaceae),
Balanophora J.R.Forst. & G.Forst. (Balanophoraceae), Beccarinda Kuntze (Gesneriaceae), Curculigo Gaertn.
(Hypoxidaceae), Monotropa L. (Ericaceae) and Myrmechis (Lindl.) Blume (Orchidaceae). The mitriform
perianth suggests myophily (Stone 1980), and a small dipteran species was found visiting T. gongshanensis at
the time of collection.
Discussion:—Thismia gongshanensis most closely resembles T. tuberculata, which was classified in sect.
Glaziocharis (Taubert) Hatusima (1976: 4). Both species have spathulate inner perianth lobes that are apically
imbricate, arching inward distally and forming a mitre over the perianth chamber (imbricated); both whorls of
perianth lobes have relatively long subulate appendages; the outer surface of the perianth tube is densely
tuberculate. However, the two species are distinct: T. gongshanensis has longer stems (ca. 6–10 cm) at
anthesis; inner tepal appendages are about 10–15mm in length and just a little longer than outer tepal
appendages; stamens are separate, pistil composed of 2 simple stigmas and 2 parietal placentas; and perianth
is yellow. However, T. tuberculata has a shorter stem (ca. 3–4 cm) at anthesis; inner tepal appendages are up
to ca. 15–20 mm in length and much longer than the outer tepal appendages; every pair of adjacent stamens is
almost adnate; pistil is composed of 3 broadly triquetrous-ovate or capitate stigmas and 3 parietal placentas;
the perianth is whitish.
Etymology:—The name of the species was chosen for the place where it was collected. Maku village is in
the Dulong River watershed of Gongshan County, northwestern Yunnan, China, neighboring Burma in the
west. Its Chinese name should be spelled “gongshan shui yu bei (
)”.
Notes:—It has been stated that Thismia has 3 carpels and 3 placentas, with 3 simple or 3 bilobate stigmas
or 1 capitate stigma (Jonker 1938, Maas et al. 1986). However, T. gongshanensis has 2 carpels and 2
placentas, with 2 simple stigmas; these character states are possibly derived. Thus, we keep the sectional
position unplaced temporarily.
