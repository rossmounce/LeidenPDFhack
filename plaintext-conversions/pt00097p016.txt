Abstract
Botanists estimate that 80 to 90% of existing plant species have already been described and it is expected that most
undescribed species are rare or narrow endemic ones. Here we map the geographical distribution of Gymnanthes
boticario, a species described in 2010, and show that the species is not only widespread, but was well-collected in the
Caatinga semiarid vegetation prior to its description. During a revision of the genus Gymnanthes we also found
collections of G. boticario in the Brazilian Mato Grosso do Sul state (in Pantanal ecoregion), in Paraguay (in Cerro Léon
dry forests) and in Bolivia (in Chiquitano dry forest ecoregion) in a pattern that closely resembles the Pleistocenic Arc
Hypothesis. We map the continental distribution of G. boticario, report the first records of it for Bolivia, Paraguay and
the Brazilian Pantanal and show the rich data available in herbaria for a plant only recently described.
Key words: Bolivia, Brazil, Chiquitano, Ecoregions of South America, Hippomaneae, Paraguay

Introduction
The Pleistocenic Arc Hypothesis
South America has a large number of different vegetation types and ecosystems, ranging from
superhumid rainforest such as the Amazonian and Atlantic forests to deserts in Chilean and Peruvian coasts
(Cabrera & Willink 1973, Olson et al. 2001). Distributed throughout South America, there are also many
disjunct areas where semiarid conditions prevail, and in which there is a shortage in water availability for
most of the year (Pennington et al. 2000, 2006a, Prado 2000). Of these, the Caatinga dry formation, a variable
complex of semiarid vegetation that occupies most of the Northeastern region of Brazil, is the largest area,
with some 800,000 km2 (Prado 2003, IBGE [Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística] 2004).
During part of the twentieth century, biogeographers assumed that the tropical semiarid Caatinga in Brazil
and subtropical, frost prone semiarid Chaco in Argentina and Paraguay were ecologically similar and shared
floristic links (Cabrera & Willink 1973, Rizzini 1979, Prado & Gibbs 1993). In a seminal paper, Prado &
Gibbs (1993) tested the alleged floristic similarity between Caatinga and Chaco, plotting species distributions
and showing that the links between Caatinga and Chaco were negligible, but that there were, however, many

disjunct distributions between Caatinga and other dry formations of South America. While the flora of Chaco
was almost entirely different, Caatinga shared species with dry formations such as the Chiquitano dry forests
in Bolivia, the dry valleys of the Andes in Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia and the dry coast of
Venezuela (Prado & Gibbs 1993, Pennington et al. 2000, Prado 2000). Prado & Gibbs (1993) explained the
large number of disjunct taxa between these widely separated semiarid areas with the following scenario.
During the Pleistocene glaciations the climate was drier, causing wet forests to reduce in area and dry
formations to spread to a much larger extent (Werneck et al. 2011). After the glaciations, with a wetter
climate, dry formations reduced in area and were split into separate nuclei (Pennington et al. 2000; Werneck et
al. 2011). But as a legacy of their joint history, they now share a number of species, genera and lineages.
Based on these shared taxa, Prado (2000) and Pennington et al. (2000) suggested that these semiarid disjunct
areas should be considered a single, large phytogeographical domain called Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest
(SDTF) or Dry Plant Formations (Sarmiento 1975).
Sarmiento (1975) had already called attention to the similarities between dry vegetation formations across
South America. And, based on the many floristic disjunctions recorded by Prado & Gibbs (1993), it was
proposed that distant dry forests of South America shared floristic links and a common history, leading this
idea to be the focus of much debate in the last 20 years (Prado & Gibbs 1993, Pennington et al. 2000, 2006b,
Dirzo et al. 2011). Criticism of the hypothesis has emerged too. Mayle (2006) argued that the pollen data
available to date are not consistent with the Pleistocenic Arc Scenario and suggested that multiple long
distance dispersal events between Caatinga and other dry formations could also explain the observed pattern.
The debate continues and while some prefer to consider the possibility of multiple dispersal events (e.g.
Mayle 2006), others admit that at least between the dry Caatinga and Chiquitano areas there is support for a
more widespread occurrence of dry vegetation in the past (e.g. Linares-Palomino et al. 2011). In any case
there is a striking number of disjunct occurrences of species or lineages known to be present in the Caatinga
and other dry vegetation of America, but which do not occur in the Cerrado savannas nor in the wet forests
between them (see examples in Prado & Gibbs 1993, Taylor & Zappi 2004 and Lewis et al. 2006).
Gymnanthes boticario in Caatinga and beyond
Historically, the semiarid Caatinga was one of the most scientifically overlooked areas of Brazil.
Assumed to be poor in species diversity and endemism, few efforts to study its flora and establish nature
reserves were made up to the 1990s, and even now less than 2% of its area is protected by Nature Reserves
(Tabarelli & Vicente 2002, Castelletti et al. 2003). Studies in Caatinga intensified sharply in the last decade
and now show that the Caatinga is a semiarid area rich in plant diversity and with many endemic genera and
species [e.g. the monotypic genera Holoregmia Nees von Esenbeck (1821: 300) (Harley et al. 2003) and
various species of Fabaceae (Queiroz 2009), Cactaceae (Taylor & Zappi 2004) and Euphorbiaceae (Lucena &
Alves 2010)]. In 2002 a first synthesis of the plant biodiversity in the Caatinga was prepared (Sampaio et al.
2002), and in 2006 a general catalogue of the plant species was published (Giulietti et al. 2006), recognizing
5344 species in the Brazilian semiarid region and 1511 species in the Caatinga sensu stricto vegetation. A new
list of species was published in 2010 as part of the List of Plants of Brazil, recording 4320 Angiosperms for
the semiarid region of Brazil (Caatinga Phytogeographical Domain, or Caatinga sensu lato) (Forzza et al.
2010). Several new species have been published since this recent comprehensive list, including the subject of
this paper, G. boticario.
Gymnanthes boticario Esser, M.F.Lucena & M.Alves (2010: 345) is a Euphorbiaceae species, of the
Hippomaneae tribe, recently described from the Caatinga vegetation in Northeastern Brazil (Esser et al.
2010). The plant is easily recognized in the genus by the presence of indumentum, usually serrate (rarely
entire) margins of the leaves, the short petiole, densely tomentose ovary and subsessile fruits. In the
protologue, 14 collections from Bahia, Ceará, Pernambuco, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte states are cited,
indicating that the plant has a wide distributional range. During a general revision of Gymnanthes Swartz
(1788: 6) by the first author, dozens of other specimens of this plant were recorded in many herbaria,
demonstrating a surprising amount of unpublished distributional data available about such a newly recognized

plant, and stimulating us to map the occurrences of it. A study visit to G, K and M herbaria revealed new
records for Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, indicating that this new species is not only
well collected, but also quite widely distributed in South America, with a pattern that matches closely the
Pleistocenic Arc proposed by Prado & Gibbs (1993). Our purposes are thus 1) to record the history of
collections made of G. boticario up to its description, exploring the factors that may cause a widely collected
plant to remain unrecognized a long time before description; 2) to map the known distribution of the plant,
revealing its ecological preferences; 3) to report the first records for G. boticario for the dry forests of Pantanal
ecoregion in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil; for Paraguay, in Cerro Léon dry forests; and also for Bolivia, in
Chiquitano dry forests, also contributing to the Catalogue of Vascular Plants of Bolivia, now in preparation;
and 4) to discuss the implications of this new disjunct record for the hypothesis of the Pleistocenic Arc.

Material & Methods
How many years and how many collections are necessary to allow for a new species to be recognized?
To determine the amount of data available and the geographical distribution for Gymnanthes boticario up
to the year of the species description, we consulted material deposited in the herbaria ALCB, B, BM, BR,
CEPEC, EAC, G, GUA, HRB, HUEFS, HVASF, IPA, JPB, K, M, MAC, OXF, P, PEUFR, RB, TEPB, UFP,
UFRN, Z and also received by loan material from ASE, BA, BHCB, CESJ, CEN, CH, CIB, COR, CRI,
CTES, ESA, F, FLOR, FURB, HB, HRCB, HUFU, HXBX, HUM, IAC, IBGE, ICN, IAN, INB, INPA, JBSD,
LD, LIL, LPB, MBM, MBML, MEXU, MICH, PACA, PMG, R, RBR, SMDB, SP, SPF, UB, UEC, UFMT,
UPCB, VIC, VIES, XAL, WU (acronyms follow Index Herbariorum 2012). As G. boticario was only recently
recognized, we consulted with special attention material labeled as “undetermined” in Euphorbiaceae, and
collections under closely related and/or morphologically similar genera and families [especially Actinostemon
Mart. ex Klotzsch (1841: 184), Microstachys Jussieu (1824: 48), Sebastiania Sprengel (1821: 118), and
Salicaceae]. Collections labeled under Gymnanthes sp. were always evaluated, as part of a revision of
Gymnanthes in progress by the first author and we built a database of all recorded sheets with the taxonomic
and geographical data associated with the collections (herbarium code, collecting locality, names previously
applied to herbarium sheets etc). The list of consulted material is presented in Appendix 1.
Mapping the distribution of Gymnanthes boticario
From each collection in the consulted herbaria we recorded the following geographical data from the
sheets: GPS coordinates when available, locality and town of collection and Brazilian State or Bolivian/
Paraguayan department. When GPS coordinates were recorded we plotted the points in a GIS environment
and checked if the point was within the political borders reported on the sheet. Collections without GPS
coordinates or for which coordinates were clearly wrong were mapped using the geographical location of the
town or a more specific locality reported on the specimen label (a known mountain, or a national park).
To understand the biogeographical pattern of distribution of G. boticario we selected from the Olson et al.
(2001) map of ecoregions of the world, the dry formations of South America using the definitions and maps
presented by Sarmiento (1975) and Pennington et al. (2006b). We plotted the dry formations together with the
Cerrado, Pantanal and Chaco ecoregions and then added to the map the collection locations of G. boticario.

Results
How many years and how many collections are necessary to allow for a new species to be recognized?
The first collection of Gymnanthes boticario we are aware was made in 1971, but the species was
described only in 2010 (Esser et al. 2010). So at least 39 years elapsed from the first collection to the
description [Fig. 1]. Up to 2010 there were 82 collections of G. boticario available in 18 herbaria [Fig. 2], with
50 further duplicates distributed to 21 herbaria [Fig. 3], resulting in a total of 132 sheets in 25 herbaria in six

countries (Bolivia, Brazil, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States) up to the year of the
description of the species. Two further collections (Oliveira & A. Laurênio 211 and Siqueira-Filho et al. 2663,
not included in the statistics presented here, but listed in the examined material—Appendix 1) were made
after 2010. Most of the collections were labeled as Gymnanthes sp. (27 sheets) or Sebastiania sp. (25 sheets).
The other names applied were Euphorbiaceae (15), Actinostemon sp. (8), Sebastiania cf. serrata (3), S. aff.
brasiliensis (2), S. vestita (1) and Maprounea sp. (1) [Fig. 4]. Up to 2010, when G. boticario was described,
the 82 collections available already covered five of the eight recognized subregions of Caatinga (called by
Velloso et al. 2002 “ecorregions” of Caatinga) and seven of the ten Brazilian states where Caatinga vegetation
occurs (as well as one collection in Cerro Léon, Paraguay; two collections for the Brazilian Pantanal, in Mato
Grosso do Sul state; and two collections in the Chiquitano dry forests in Bolivia) [Figs. 5–7]. However, only
17% of these collections had been examined by the authors of G. boticario in the protologue, because they
were not attempting a monographic approach, but simply citing collections to hand at that time.

Mapping the distribution of Gymnanthes boticario
The distribution of the G. boticario in northeastern Brazil was clearly related to the Dry Caatingas, and not
to the Cerrado savannas or the Atlantic rainforests which are together the three main Phytogeographical
Domains of Northeastern Brazil. We found 77 collections of G. boticario in the semiarid region of Brazil, all
of them related to the Caatinga or at most to the ecotonal areas to Cerrado, but none in Cerrado vegetation or
Atlantic rainforest itself. One collection was from an ecotonal area between Caatinga and Cerrado (Fernandes
& Matos s.n., Eliseu Martins, Piauí).
Piauí, Bahia and Minas Gerais have extensive areas of Cerrado vegetation, but all collections we
encountered in these states were made in the Caatinga or at most in ecotonal areas, showing the preference of
G. boticario for dry vegetation [Fig. 6]. This preference is even more evident when we analyze the distribution
of the plant in the South American continent as a whole [Fig. 7]. The only other points we could locate outside
the Caatinga were in the Cerro Léon, Alto Paraguay department; in the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz;
and in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul (collections made close to the Bolivian and Paraguayan
borders). These areas represent respectively the Cerro Léon dry forests of Northern Paraguay; the Chiquitano
Dry Forest ecoregion; and dry forests of hilly areas of the Pantanal ecoregion (in the case of the collections
Prance et al. 26151 and Bernardi 20426). The Chiquitano and Caatinga are considered by Pennington et al.
(2000) as SDTF. The Cerro Léon is a particular vegetation that occurs inside the Chaco ecoregion, but has a
flora related to dry forest and not to the surrounding Chaco (it is, in a certain sense, an enclave of dry forests
within the Chaco—Prado & Gibbs 1993, Werneck et al. 2011). In the Pantanal, known primarily as a wetland,
there are many patches of dry forests (deciduous or semideciduous forests) that occur in hills scattered across
the landscape and harbor a flora which species come from both the Cerrado and from other dry formations of
South America (Prance & Schaller 1982, Damasceno Júnior et al. 2009). The distribution of G. boticario

adheres closely to the distribution expected by the model of the Pleistocenic Arc, which argues that during
drier glacial times dry formations expanded to a larger extent than the actual one (Werneck et al. 2011) and
constituted a larger arc of dry vegetation surrounding the wet forests, Cerrado and the Chaco. According to the
model, these dry formations fragmented again in wetter post glacial times and the dry areas became isolated
[see actual distribution in Fig. 7], but retained some floristic elements that were separated by this vicariance
event.

Discussion
How many years and how many collections are necessary to allow for a new species to be recognized?
Most plant species published as new to science in recent years are described from relatively small ranges,
often based on just a few herbarium collections (Joppa et al. 2011), leading sometimes to the assumption that
species remaining to be described are narrow endemics and that most of the “common” plants have been
already published. But here we have a case of common, widely distributed and well collected newly described
species. Although widely collected in Brazil, almost four decades elapsed between the time of the earliest
known collection of G. boticario and the time of its publication. This elapsed time may seem long but is, in
fact, close to recently published estimates of the mean time that species in general remain undescribed after
first collected (Bebber et al. 2010), and reinforces the importance of the continuing taxonomic work in Brazil
as a means of revealing the many new plants waiting to be discovered (Pimm et al. 2010), not all of them
particularly rare, as shown here.
Why did Gymanthes boticario lie undiscovered in so many herbaria for so long? Our results show that in
33% of the collections, it had been correctly identified to genus level [27 collections were deposited in
herbaria as Gymnanthes sp.—see Fig. 4] and in a similar number of cases it had been assigned to a closely
related genus (25 collections of Sebastiania sp.) or simply assigned to family level (15 collections as
Euphorbiaceae) [Fig. 4]. It seems that “generalist” botanists were succeeding in getting the material correctly
determinated to or close to the genus level. Which factors resulted in a long delay in recognizing G. boticario
as new to science? Unclear taxonomic boundaries and the dearth of specialists and monographs for the
Hippomaneae tribe are obvious reasons.
Bebber et al. (2010) show how continuous intensive taxonomic work in a particular group can increase
efficiency in recognizing new species. When the first monograph for Neotropical Chrysobalanaceae was
completed, the mean time for recognizing new species was 35 years, while the mean time for recognizing new
species in subsequent works on this group was only 10.5 years (Bebber et al. 2010). Hippomaneae is a large
group in the Euphorbiaceae family (33 genera and 330 species worldwide; 13 genera and about 120 species in
Brazil; Esser 2012) and lacks much taxonomic input. For the 13 Brazilian genera of Hippomaneae, only five
have recently published revisions, and Gymnanthes is recognized as one of the critical genera, both in Brazil
and the world (Esser 2012, Secco et al. 2012), so it is not surprising that new species in this group are a long
time waiting to be recognized.
Moreover, before the 1990s Caatinga was poorly studied, but in the last decade the number of publications
about Caatinga has increased and a large number of syntheses, catalogues, taxonomic treatments and new
species have been published (Sampaio et al. 2002, Taylor & Zappi 2004, Giulietti et al. 2006, Queiroz 2009,
Forzza et al. 2010). The discovery of narrow endemic species are happy surprises, but as shown in our
distribution map and consulted material list [Figs. 5–6; Appendix 1] Gymnanthes boticario is a widespread
and well collected plant in Caatinga. It is clear that more taxonomic effort is needed in this region of Brazil
(Pimm et al. 2010). Fortunately this need is beginning to be addressed and not only has more taxonomic work
been undertaken there in the last two decades, but also many new species have been recognized recently (e.g.
Carneiro-Torres et al. 2011)
Mapping the distribution of Gymnanthes boticario
As our distribution maps make clear, Gymnanthes boticario is widespread in the Caatinga and has a
marked preference for dry formations. All collections of G. boticario are material coming from SDTF (sensu
Pennington et al. 2000) or at most from their ecotonal areas to Cerrado or dry forests within Pantanal. But we
didn’t find evidence of G. boticario occurring in Cerrado vegetation itself. In Piauí, Bahia and Minas Gerais
states, Cerrado and Caatinga are contiguous and the Cerrado covers large areas (IBGE [Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estatística], 2004). If G. boticario was also a characteristic element of Cerrado vegetation we
would expect at least some collections there. Moreover we didn’t locate any collections from central Brazil.
The species seems to be absent from Cerrado areas and reappears only in the dry Chiquitano forests in

Bolivia, in the dry forests of Cerro Léon, in Paraguay, or in dry forests in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul.
Both Caatinga and Chiquitano are part of the SDTF that according to the model of Prado & Gibbs (1993) were
part of the once extensive arc of dry forests of South America (Werneck et al. 2011), which could explain the
large number of disjunctions observed between these areas.
The collection Prance et al. 26151 was made in the Pantanal, close to the border with Bolivia, in a site
now belonging to the Mato Grosso do Sul state, Corumbá municipality (the state of Mato Grosso was split in
two in 1979 and the place where Prance et al. collected is now Mato Grosso do Sul). Describing the site of this
collection Prance & Schaller (1982) deemed it a mosaic of vegetation and a confluence of different floras,
where elements of Cerrado, Amazonia and Chaco flora mix. This area is also on the outskirts of the
Chiquitano Dry Forest ecoregion (Olson et al. 2001), an area of ecological tension. So it is not surprising that
the G. boticario was found there. Bernardi made his collection of G. boticario in the “Cerro Pedrera, riacho
Navileque, Paraguay” (Bernardi 20426). But Navileque river is located in Brazilian territory, in the Pantanal
ecoregion. Lorenzo Ramella (from herbarium G) kindly provided us with a transcription of Bernardi’s notes
of his field trips, and it seems clear that he, while collecting in Paraguay, entered many kilometers in Brazilian
territory without realizing he had done so. So we could locate two collections of G. boticario to the Pantanal
ecoregion in Mato Grosso do Sul state. Pantanal is one of the largest wetland areas in the world, but within the
flooded areas there are hills which are never flooded and harbor dry forests (Damasceno Júnior et al. 2009).
These show a diverse flora, mixing species of Cerrado and dry forests, that are interspersed with swampy
vegetation and gallery forests (Prance & Schaller 1982, Damasceno Júnior et al. 2009). Prance’s collection is
recorded as being made from forest on slopes in higher areas and Bernardi’s collection was made in higher
areas of a hill (cerro, in Spanish). These never-flooded areas have dry forests in the slopes (Prance & Schaller
1982) and are thus the type of environment where G. boticario could be expected outside Caatinga.
An interesting collection was made in the Cerro Léon in Paraguay. This mountain supports dry forests, but
is completely surrounded by the Chaco plains. While the Chaco plains have a flora very different from the dry
formations of South America, Cerro Léon has different soil types and many plant species shared with other
dry formations of the continent (Prado & Gibbs 1993). Gymnanthes boticario is a new example of the links of
Cerro Léon with disjunct dry areas.
It should be noted that the Cerrado ecoregion is not a homogeneous vegetation type. Within the Cerrado
one can find the typical cerrado sensu stricto vegetation, which has a savannah physiognomy, but also
grasslands (campo limpo e campo sujo), arboreous cerrado (cerradão), gallery forests, and a different type of
dry forest, which is known as deciduous calcareous dry forests (or limestone outcrop vegetation, Mata Seca
em solo Calcário; Ribeiro & Walter 2008). Floristic and phytosociological studies in these dry deciduous
forests within the Cerrado have collected many taxa typical of the semiarid Caatinga that do not occur in
Cerrado sensu stricto. Examples are Aspidosperma pyrifolium Martius (1824: 60), Commiphora leptophloeos
(Martius 1828: 393) Gillett (1980: 582) and Cavanillesia arborea (Willd.) Schumann (1886: 327) (Felfili et
al. 2007, Lima et al. 2010, Carvalho & Felfili 2011). If Gymanthes boticario does occur within the Cerrado
Phytogeographical Domain, we would expect it to be in these calcareous dry forests within the Cerrado, not in
Cerrado vegetation itself. Collecting G. boticario in the limestone forests would lend even more support to the
Pleistocenic Arc hypothesis, as these small patches of dry forests within the Cerrado can be seen as the
remnants of the dry vegetation that once covered much larger areas of South America.
An alternative hypothesis to the Pleistocenic Arc is that many different taxa made independent long
distance migrations through the Cerrado to other dry formations of South America. Mayle (2006) concluded
in favor of this idea because available pollen data were not congruent with the model of the Pleistocenic Arc.
But he also acknowledged that the palynological data is, as yet, very incomplete and a newer-evaluation is
desirable once more information is available. Linares-Palomino et al. (2011) compared floristic resemblances
of many of the dry nuclei in Latin America. They concluded that relatively close areas showed reasonable
floristic congruence, but that the whole set of South American dry areas cannot be joined in a single floristic
unit because of large differences among them. They identified four major SDTF regions and one of these four
comprised the Chiquitano forest, Caatinga and other Brazilian SDTFs.

It is striking that disjunct distributions that conform to the Pleistocenic Arc (not only species, but also
subgeneric level occurrences) are reported in many cases among Cactaceae (Taylor & Zappi 2004),
Leguminosae (Lewis et al. 2006) and also other families (Prado & Gibbs 1993). G. boticario conforms well to
this model. Moreover Linares-Palomino et al. (2011) found a reasonable similarity between Chiquitano forest
and Caatinga, and Lima et al. (2010) and Carvalho & Felfili (2011) report some disjunctions between
limestone dry forests within Cerrado and Caatinga. Perhaps the true scenario is a much more complex
dynamic in the past of the continent, with large scale community migrations at some times (maybe not only in
the Pleistocene) combined with long distance dispersal events. In this case, the limestone dry forests within
Cerrado could represent either remnants of a former larger dry area or stepping stone environments allowing
dry forest species to cross the Cerrado. In either case we predict that new records for G. boticario will be
found in the limestone outcrop forests within the Cerrado.
It is remarkable for G. boticario to be so specific to dry formations. It occurs in many disjunct SDTF sites
in South America, including small patches of seasonal forests within the Pantanal and in Cerro Léon hills,
which is surrounded by Chaco vegetation, but we could find no evidence of it occurring in other vegetation of
the continent as cerrado sensu stricto, Chaco or rain forests. Probable new sites to collect this plant are the
limestone outcrop dry forests within Cerrado and Bolivian Andean dry valleys. If this species is collected in
these sites, it will strengthen even more the plant as a Pleistocenic Arc distribution model.

Conclusion
Gymnanthes boticario is an example of reasonably common and well collected plant that took a long time to
be recognized as new. This illustrates the fact that the plants remaining to be described are not necessarily
narrow endemics or plants from remote and unpopulated areas. The plant occurs is in readily accessible places
and had been available for many years in different herbaria prior to recognition, showing the need for more
specialist work on Caatinga plants.
Regarding the plant’s distribution, it can now be listed among the many cases of dry formation specialists
recorded separately from distant patches of SDTFs of South America (Prado & Gibbs 1993, Taylor & Zappi
2004, Lewis et al. 2006). We make the first record of Gymnanthes botcario in Bolivia and Paraguay and bring
to light collections of it in slope forests of hills (cerros) in Pantanal, also making the first record for the state of
Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Further collecting in the limestone dry forests within Cerrado and in the Dry
Andean Bolivian Valleys are predicted to yield new records of the plant.
Up to date G. boticario conforms well to the model proposed by the Pleistocenic Arc hypothesis, but this,
of course, does not prove it. As highlighted by Mayle (2006), long distance dispersal could also explain this
pattern, although many repeated disjunct patterns (Prado & Gibbs 1993) makes this unlikely. Maybe a more
complex model will be needed for understanding historical vegetation shifts in South America, taking into
account both vegetational shifts and possible long distance dispersal events. Genetic comparisons between
populations may be an interesting tool to address these questions and we suggest Gymnanthes boticario as a
good candidate for future population genetic studies.
