Abstract
The rare boreo-alpine, oligotraphenic diatom Planothidium distinctum (= Achnanthes distincta) was first described from
the western Alps in 1954. Achnanthes hirta, a species described in 1970 from the Pyrenees, is regarded as a heterotypic
synonym of Planothidium distinctum but almost all morphological details of P. distinctum are known from the type
material of Achnanthes hirta. On the basis of reinvestigation of original samples typification and emended description of
P. distinctum were carried out by means of LM and SEM. This study extends the distribution of P. distinctum to the
Carpathians where occasional valves were found in the lateglacial (ca 15,000–14,000 cal yr BP) lacustrine sediment of a
mountain lake (Retezat Mts, Southern Carpathians, Romania).

Introduction
Planothidium distinctum (Messikommer) Lange-Bertalot (1999: 281) was first described by Messikommer as
Achnanthes distincta (Messikommer 1954: 32), who found it in three samples collected in the western part of
the Alps (Urner Reusstales, Switzerland) at two localities, though not in any abundance. The three samples
(material squeezed from mosses overgrowing rocks in an outflow from “Lauteren Seeli”) were included in the
species protologue, along with a Latin diagnosis and two drawings illustrating raphe- and rapheless valves
(Messikommer 1954: 32, pl. 1, figs 2a, 2b, reproduced here as Figs 1, 2). Since the designation of type
material was not obligatory before 1958 (Jahn & Kusber 2009, McNeil et al. 2012), the description of
Achnanthes distincta is valid.
Achnanthes hirta Carter (1970: 609) was described from material collected by J. Broadhead during the
summer of 1966 and 1967 in Andorra (Carter 1970, Williams & Reid 2002). A detailed description of the
“well defined form” (Carter 1970: 609) included drawings of both the raphe and rapheless valves (Carter
1970: pl. 1, figs 10, 11, reproduced here as Figs 3, 4). A holotype (BM 77780) was designated from “Sample
No. 2 from a ditch near Llorts” (Carter 1970, Williams & Reid 2002).
The first micrographs of Achnanthes hirta were published by Lange-Bertalot and Krammer in their
comprehensive monograph on Achnanthes (Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989: Pl. 31, figs 2, 3; pl. 40, figs 10–
17). The only remark made by Lange-Bertalot and Krammer on the morphology of A. hirta refers to its striae
structure, which is constructed of three rows of areolae near the valve edge, reducing to two rows towards the
axial area (Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989: 65). Their description of A. hirta is accompanied by twelve light
microscope (LM) and two scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Four of the LM pictures were taken

from type material (BM 77780, Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989: pl. 40, figs 10, 10’, 11, 12); two images are
of specimens from the USA, appended with a reference to Achnanthes stewartii (Patrick 1945: 169) (LangeBertalot & Krammer 1989: pl. 40, figs 13, 13’); one image is from Iceland (Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989:
pl. 40, fig.14); and four images are from the Alps (Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989: pl. 40, figs 15–17). The
SEM illustrations (Lange-Bertalot & Krammer 1989: pl. 31, figs 3, 4) show only the external view of a
rapheless valve, which most probably originated from the type material, indicated in caption as “Leg. J.
Carter”.
According to Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1991: 32), Achnanthes hirta is a synonym of A. distincta, the
latter having priority. Achnanthes distincta was illustrated, however, by type specimens of A. hirta (Krammer
& Lange-Bertalot 1991: Plate 18: 1–4) and two valves from the Alps, of unknown origin (Krammer & LangeBertalot 1991: 18, figs 5, 6).
Later, Achnanthes distincta was invalidly transferred to the genus Achnantheiopsis Lange-Bertalot (1997:
200), but eventually transferred to Planothidium (Lange-Bertalot 1999: 281) where is currently resides.
Recently, a few valves identified as Planothidium distinctum were found during an on-going
paleolimnological survey carried out on a sediment core of Lake Lia in the Retezat Mountains, South
Carpathians, Romania. To clarifying the identity of this diatom, type material of Achnanthes distincta were
studied by means of LM and SEM that resulted in the emended description herein.

Material and Methods
Material
The following material was examined:
1. Messikommer’s type material of Achnanthes distincta. The species was reported from three samples
(Messikommer 1954): Nr. 2, Nr. 4 and Nr. 5. For sample Nr. 2 specimens were rare (“spärlich”); for
samples Nr. 4 and Nr. 5 specimens were not so rare (“nicht selten”).
Sample Nr. 4: ”Lauteres Seeli. Alt. 2250 m. Gewinnung von Ausquetschmaterial aus ins Gewässer
hineinragenden Phanerogamenwurzeln am Kliff. Karbonathärte des Seewassers 2,5° (fr. H.), pH 6,9–7,0.
Entnahmedatum wie oben, aber 14h15“.
Sample Nr. 5. “Dito. Entnahme von Grundschlammaterial. Entnahmededingungen wie oben“.
A small, dried quantity of material from sample Nr. 4 and Nr. 5 donated to BP (Hungarian Natural History
Museum, Budapest) from Z (Universität Zürich, Institut für Systematische Botanik, Messikommer
collection). Samples numbered: BP 2013/18 and BP 2013/19, slides BP 2208 and BP 2215. a
2. Lake Lia, core samples between 748 and 721 cm: Material and permanent slides BP 2012/275– 2012/289.
Site description: Lake Lia is a shallow mountain lake (max. water–depth 4.3 meter, volume ca. 16,000 m3,
perimeter 512 m) with a surface area of 1.3 ha (Onciu & Radu 2006, Straškrábová et al. 2006) in the Retezat
Mountains, South Carpathians, Romania (45°35'30"N, 22°87'87"E). The triangle-shaped Lake Lia is the
lowest (1910 m a.s.l.) amongst the lakes of the Bucura cirque. The lake conductivity is low (13 µS cm-1);
alkalinity is 36 eq l-1; dissolved organic carbon (DOC) 0.61 mg l-1, dissolved nitrogen 335 g l-1, dissolved
phosphorous 3.8 g l-1. (Straškrábová et al. 2006). The pH varies between 6.4–6.7 (János Korponai pers.
com.)

Methods
The 875-cm long sediment core was taken from Lake Lia with a modified Livingstone piston corer (7-cm
diameter) in July 2008. The core was sub-sampled at every 2 cm for diatom analysis. For analyses of the
siliceous algae, samples were prepared using standard digestion procedures (Battarbee 1986). Approximately
350 valves were counted from each sample using a light microscope (LEICA DM LB2 with 100 HCX PLAN
APO objective). The cleaned sample was air-dried on an aluminium stub, sputter-coated with gold-palladium
and studied in a Hitachi S-26000N scanning electron microscope.
Morphological terminology follows Hendey (1964), Barber & Haworth (1981) and Round et al. (1990).

Emended description of type material (Figs 5–17): Valves lanceolate with broadly protracted, rounded apices
(Figs 5–10); valve length 18.3 ±1.4 μm (min =16.1 μm, max = 20.3 μm), width 7.2 ± 0.3 μm; (min = 5.8 μm
max = 7.9 μm) (n = 18). Rapheless valve with very narrow with linear axial area. Central area small,
transversely rectangular, asymmetrical (2–3 central striae usually slightly shortened). Striae radiate
throughout valve, 12–14 in 10 μm. Raphe straight, filiform, terminal fissures turned in opposite directions.
Axial area narrow, linear. Central area small, transversely rectangular asymmetrical. Striae radiate throughout
valve, 15–16 in 10 μm. Areolae not resolvable in LM.
In SEM: externally, terminal raphe fissures very slightly curved in opposite directions (Fig. 11). Proximal
raphe endings straight, slightly expanded, (hardly ‘drop-like’) relatively distant from each other (Fig. 11).
Distance between central pores on outer surface shorter than inner surface, 1.0–1.3 m and 1.5–1.6,
respectively (Figs 11, 15). Mantle bears a row of poroids, exactly 3 x number of striae (Figs 11, 13, 16, 17).
Internally, central raphe endings deflected in opposite directions. Transapical striae usually composed of two
rows of alternating small, round areolae (42–46 in 10 m), sometimes three, becoming biseriate towards axial
area (Fig. 12). In central area, 1–3 asymmetrically shortened striae present. Rapheless valves with narrow,
linear axial area and narrow, transversely rectangular, asymmetrical central area of variable size, dependent on
length shortened striae. Valve slightly curved in girdle view (Figs 11, 12, 15, 17).
Notes:—Messikommer’s sample Nr. 4 contained a few valves of Planothidium distinctum, while none
occurred in sample Nr. 5, hence the choice of lectotype. According to Messikommer (1954), the most frequent
diatoms in this sample were Achnanthes austriaca var. helvetica Hustedt (1933: 385), Achnanthes linearis (W.
Smith) Grunow in Cleve & Grunow (1880: 23), Cymbella ventricosa Kützing (1844: 80), Gomphonema
intricatum var. pumilum Grunow (in Van Heurck 1880: pl. 24, figs 35, 36), Navicula schmassmannii Hustedt
(1943: 400), and Nitzschia fonticola (Grunow) Grunow in Van Heurck (1881: pl. 69, fig.15–20).
Description of material from Lake Lia, Retezat Mountains (Figs 19–32): Valve length 19.8 ±1.4 μm (min
= 17.6 μm, max = 22.5 μm), width 7.6 ± 0.1 μm; (min = 7.2 μm, max = 8.3 μm) (n = 27). Striae are radiate
throughout valve, 13–14 in 10 μm (n =27). In SEM, externally, terminal raphe fissures slightly curved in
opposite directions (Fig. 29). Proximal raphe endings straight, simple, not expanded, relatively distant from
each other (Fig. 11). Distance between central pores on outer surface shorter than inner surface, 1.0–1.3 m
and 1.5–1.6, respectively (Figs 29, 30). Mantle bears a row of poroids, exactly 3 x number of striae (Figs 29–
32). Internally, central raphe endings deflected in opposite directions (Fig. 30). Transapical striae always
composed of two rows of alternating small, round areolae (42–46 in 10 m ). In central area, 1–3
asymmetrically shortened striae present. Rapheless valves narrow, linear axial area and narrow, transversely
rectangular, asymmetrical central area of variable size, dependent on length of shortened striae. Valve plain,
not curved in girdle view.
Notes:—Preservation of the valves was poor with several corroded forms detected. In the Lake Lia,
Retezat Mountains material Planothidium distinctum co-occurred with Navicula digitulus Hustedt (1943:
162), Staurosira venter (Ehrenberg) Grunow (1882: 139), Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kützing) Czarnecki
(1994: 157), Diatoma mesodon (Ehrenberg) Kützing (1844: 47) and Diadesmis perpusilla (Grunow) D.G.

Discussion
These detailed morphological and morphometric studies reveal differences between the specimens found in
the populations from type material and specimens found from the Lake Lia material. Namely, (1) dimensions
(2) striae pattern (3) shape of central raphe endings, and (4) shape of valves in girdle view.
(1) Dimensions: valves in the type material are noticeably smaller than in material from Lake Lia (Table
1, fig. 33). In the protologue for Achnanthes disticta, Messikommer (1954) provided dimensions for one valve
only, which was length 17.5 m , width 7.5 m . Further examination of specimens from type material
extended these sizes: 16–20 m in length and 5.8–7.9 m in width (Table 1, fig. 33). The dimensions given in

Messikommer’s protologue (length 17.5 m , width 7.5 m ) are close to the mean population values.
Specimens from the Retezat Mts. have larger valves, but the dimensions of the two populations overlap.

Planothidium distinctum.

(2) Striae morphology: The striae are always biseriate in the specimens from Lake Lia but, in some cases,
multiseriate in specimens from type material. Occasionally three rows of areolae can be detected close to the
valve edge that becomes biseriate towards the axial area. These features can be found in type material and
were illustrated on valves from Andorra by Lange-Bertalot and Krammer (1989).
(3) Shape of central raphe endings: The central pores are simple in specimens from Lake Lia, but
expanded in the type material. Messikommer illustrated a large, symmetrical central area on the raphe valve,
with well marked central pores, while specimens illustrated by Carter (1970), as well as valves from Lake Lia,
have a small, asymmetrical central area and the central raphe ends are simple.
(4) The shapes of valves in girdle view: All specimens from the Lake Lia population have valve that are
not curved when seen in girdle view, while some slightly curved valves were found in specimens from the
type population.
Specimens from type material and from Lake Lia have prominent poroids on valve mantle, with exactly
three times the number of striae. According to Round and Bukhtiyarova (1996), species in Planothidium have
a valve mantle with rather an inconspicuous ring of mantle pores.
Achnanthes stewartii, a species similar to Planothidium distinctum, according to Lange-Bertalot and
Krammer (1989: 31), was described by Patrick for specimens from Lake Wallenpaupach, USA (Patrick 1945:
169, Plate 2, figs 1–3). Morphological similarities between Achnanthes stewartii and A. distincta were noted
by Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1991, 2004: 32, 33) and A. stewartii was transferred to Planothidium as
Planothidium stewartii (Patrick) Lange-Bertalot (in Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 2004: 437). Later
Planothidium stewartii was transferred to Platessa (Potapova et al. 2012: 38) based on its raphe morphology,
which, along with some other morphological features, clearly distinguishes it from Planothidium distinctum.
Published records for P. distinctum began with specimens recorded from mountain areas: the Pyrenees,
the Alps, Scandinavia, and the Rocky Mountains, USA. The specimens recorded in Lake Lia extend its
occurrence to the Southern Carpathians in the late glacial period. Known records mainly concern lakes
(Messikommer 1954, Carter 1970, Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 1991, Juggins 2001), although it is known
from habitats threatened by temporal desiccation, such as ditches (Carter 1970), or rocks overgrown by
mosses near lake outflow (Messikommer 1954). The tolerance of temporal water deficiency is also suggested
by the abundant presence of Diadesmis perpusilla in the samples from Lake Lia.

Planothidium distinctum is a rare boreo-alpine diatom with a distribution limited to the least human
impacted environments. These areas should be protected, since they are inhabited by threatened,
oligotraphenic species, which may be the best biogeographical markers because of their narrow tolerance
ranges and peculiar ecological requirements.
