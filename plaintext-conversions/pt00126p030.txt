Abstract
Three Pestalotiopsis isolates were obtained from leaves of Coffea arabica and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa. Among them,
two isolates produced versicolorous conidia, and the other produced concolorous conidia. Phylogenetic analysis based on
a combination of ITS, β-tubulin and tef1 gene sequence data clearly confirms that they belong to two species and
distinguishes them from other species in this genus, with ex-type sequence data in GenBank. On the basis of evidence
from morphology and molecular phylogeny they are described as new species, Pestalotiopsis coffeae-arabicae sp. nov.
and P. rhodomyrtus sp. nov.
Key words: coelomycetes, phylogeny, taxonomy

Introduction
Species in the genus Pestalotiopsis have received much attention in recent years, not only because of their role
as plant pathogens, but also as common endophytes, which have been shown to produce a wide range of
chemically novel metabolites (Xu et al. 2010, Debbab et al. 2011, 2012, Maharachchikumbura et al. 2011,
2013). We surveyed the Pestalotiopsis diversity in southern China. Among them were two undescribed
species, described below, which were isolated from Coffea arabica and Rhodomyrtus tomentosa leaves.
Morphological details are provided and a comparison made with related species. Molecular characteristics
based on the DNA sequences of three gene loci (ITS, β-tubulin and tef1) were also determined.
Materials & Methods
Morphological and cultural studies
Diseased leaves of Coffea arabica and healthy leaves of Rhodomyrtus tomentosa were collected from Hainan
and Guangxi Provinces. Leaf samples were placed in clean paper bags and symptoms were recorded. A single
conidium culture technique was performed to obtain pure colonies of the fungi following the method outlined
in Chomnunti et al. (2011). The colonies were transferred to 2% potato-dextrose agar (PDA) medium and
incubated at room temperature (25°C). Sporulation was induced using sterilized carnation leaves, which were
aseptically placed on the surface of the medium with growing mycelium. The morphology of fungal colonies
was recorded following the method of Hu et al. (2007). Fungal mycelium and spores were observed under a

light microscope (Nikon 80i) and photographed. Methods of examination, photography and isolation followed
Boonmee et al. (2011). Holotypes and ex-type cultures of the two species are deposited in the Plant Pathology
Herbarium of Guizhou University (HGUP) and isotypes are deposited in Mae Fah Luang University (MFLU)
Herbarium, Chiang Rai, Thailand.
DNA sequencing and alignment
Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh cultures using a modified protocol of Doyle & Doyle (1987)
and Lee & Taylor (1990). The ITS and 5.8S region of rDNA molecule was amplified using primer pairs ITS4
and ITS5 (White et al. 1990), β-tubulin gene region was amplified with primer pairs BT2A and BT2B (Glass
& Donaldson 1995, O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997) and tef1 was amplified using the primer pairs EF1-526F and
EF1-1567R (Rehner 2001). PCR was performed with the 25 μL reaction system consisting of 19.75 μL of
double distilled water, 2.5 μL of 10× Taq buffer with MgCl2, 0.5 μL of dNTP (10 mM each), 0.5 μL of each
primer (10 μM), 0.25 μL Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μl), and 1.0 μL of DNA template. The thermal cycling
program followed Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012). The DNA sequences of ITS, beta-tubulin and tef1
regions generated in this study were submitted to GenBank.

Phylogenetic analyses
Combination sequence data obtained from three gene regions (ITS, β-tubulin and tef1) were aligned using
CLUSTALX (v. 1.83) (Thompson et al. 1997). The sequences were manually adjusted using BioEdit (Hall
1999), to allow maximum alignment and maximum sequence similarity. A maximum parsimony analysis
(MP) was performed using PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002).
Ambiguously aligned regions were excluded and gaps were treated as missing data. Trees were inferred using
the heuristic search option with TBR branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were
set up to 5,000, branches of zero length were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Tree
length [TL], consistency index [CI], retention index [RI], rescaled consistency index [RC], and homoplasy
index [HI] were determined. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 100 bootstrap
replications resulting from maximum parsimony analysis, each with 10 replicates of random stepwise addition
of taxa (Felsenstein 1985). The Kishino-Hasegawa tests (Kishino & Hasegawa 1989) were performed in order
to determine whether the trees inferred under different optimality criteria were significantly different. DNA
sequences from our Pestalotiopsis isolates were com pared with those that originated from
Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012), with Seiridium sp. (SD096) as outgroup.

The alignment file resulted in a data set comprising 2,020 characters including gaps (ITS: 1–548, β-tubulin:
549–1,015 and tef1: 1,016–2,020). Of these characters, 1,646 were constant and parsimony-uninformative.
The 374 parsimony-informative characters included in the parsimonious analyses yielded only one
parsimonious tree (Fig. 1) (TL = 1040, CI = 0.721, RI = 0.890, RC = 0.642). Twenty-nine Pestalotiopsis
isolates (22 taxa) formed a strong clade (100% bootstrap support), consisting of two subclades (1 and 2), both
with high bootstrap values (subclade 1: 93%, subclade 2: 100%). Our isolate (HGUP4230) was placed in
subclade 1, and clustered together with Pestalotiopsis trachicarpicola Y.M. Zhang & K.D. Hyde in Zhang et
al. (2012: 315), P. rosea Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde in Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012: 118) and P. adusta
(Ellis & Everh.) Steyaert (1953: 82) supported by a strong bootstrap value (96%). It displayed a very close
relationship with P. trachicarpicola with 100% bootstrap support. Isolates HGUP4015 and 4019, with only
slight sequence differences (data not shown) were assigned to subclade 2 within a sister taxon to the three
related species, P. chrysea Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde in Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012: 107), P.
umberspora Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde in Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012: 121) and P. asiatica
Maharachch. & K.D. Hyde in Maharachchikumbura et al. (2012: 104) with a credible bootstrap value (75%).

Discussion
It is important to clarify relationships amongst Pestalotiopsis species as they are not only weak pathogens, but
also prolific produces of novel medicinal compounds (Aly et al. 2011, Ko Ko et al. 2011a, b, Xu et al. 2010,
Debbab et al. 2011, 2012). Pestalotiopsis coffeae (Zimm) Y.X. Chen in Chen & Wei (1993: 25), P. neglecta
(Thüm.) Steyaert (1953: 83; IMI 296896), P. disseminata (Thüm.) Steyaert (1949: 319; IMI 281746) and P.
versicolor (Speg.) Steyaert (1949: 336; IMI 146181) have been reported isolated from Coffea arabica (Chen
& Wei 1993, http://www.herbimi.info/herbimi/). However, P. coffeae-arabicae produced obviously shorter
apical and basal appendages (11–16 μm, 3–5 μm) than P. coffeae (21.3–25.0 μm, 6.3–8.8 μm) (Ge et al. 2009).
The conidia of P. coffeae-arabicae (16–27.1 × 6.6–7.6 μm) were smaller than those of P. neglecta (20–27.1 ×
5.9–7.1 μm) and P. disseminata (18.5–27.1 × 5.9–7.1 μm), and P. versicolor (21.2–28.3 × 7.1–8.3 μm) (Ge et
al. 2009). In the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), P. coffeae-arabicae displayed a closer relationship with P. chrysea,
P. umberspora and P. asiatica. Their conidial shape and the colour of median cell were also very similar
(Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012, 2013b). The conidia of P. coffeae-arabicae are smaller than those of P.
chrysea, P. umberspora and P. asiatica (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2012, 2013b). The apical appendages of
P. coffeae-arabicae are shorter than these three related species. Conidia of P. rhodomyrtus are similar
in shape to those of P. trachicarpicola, P. rosea and P. adusta. However, the conidia of P. rhodomyrtus
are bigger than those of P. rosea and P. adusta. The apical appendages of P. rhodomyrtus are shorter than
those of P. trachicarpicola and P. rosea. Pestalotiopsis rhodomyrtus possess only one basal appendage, but
P. trachicarpicola rarely has two, and the length of their basal appendage is different. Phylogenetic
analysis also indicated that P. coffeae-arabicae and P. rhodomyrtus were distinct new species. A detailed
morphological comparison of the new species with related species is shown in Table 2.
