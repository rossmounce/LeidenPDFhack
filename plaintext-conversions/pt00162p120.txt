Abstract
A new name, Justicia prachuapensis, is proposed for an inadvertently created later homonym, J. hansenii Rueangs. &
Chantar. (2013), non Silvar. & P. Mathew (1989).

Justicia prachuapensis Rueangs. & Chantar., nom. nov., based on J. hansenii Rueangs. & Chantar., Phytotaxa 130:
43, figs. 1–3. 10 Sep 2013, non Sivar. & P. Mathew, Taxon 38: 486. 29 Aug. 1989.
Our recently proposed name, Justicia hansenii, typified by K. Rueangsawang 258 (KKU), was established for a
species found in the providence of Prachaup Khiri Khan, southwestern Thailand. Irina Belyaeva-Chamberlain (K)
pointed out that our name was a later homonym of J. hansenii Sivar. & P. Mathew, a southern Indian species.
Therefore, the new name is proposed with the epithet based on the province of the type location, Prachaup Khiri
Khan.
