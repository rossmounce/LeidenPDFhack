The absence of the cosmopolitan genus Limonium Miller (1754: no pagination) (Plumbaginaceae) in the
mega-diverse flora of the Malesian region (comprising Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, and Singapore; Merrill 1923, Ridley 1923, Steenis 1949, Backer & Bakhuizen van
den Brink Jr. 1965, Balgooy 1993, Coode et al. 1996, Balgooy 2001, Conn et al. 2004, Chong et al. 2009,
Pelser et al. 2011) has intrigued taxonomists and biogeographers since Steenis (1949) noted this. During a
field survey as part of the project on floristic and phylogenetic biogeography in the island chain of the
Philippines, Taiwan, and southern Japan, we found a population of Limonium in the northern Philippines
(Batan Islands) that represents the first record of the genus in the Malesian region. Batan Islands, comprising
10 small (≤ 83.1 km 2) oceanic islands, is the northernmost tip of the Malesian region, being ca. 190 km north
of Luzon Island of the Philippines and ca. 140 km southeast of Taiwan Island. From the geological location,
the present finding suggests that a more extensive survey in Batan Islands may add some more East Asian
temperate genera to the flora of the Malesian region, although two enumerations of the early and mid 20th
century provide us baseline knowledge of the flora of Batan Islands (Merrill 1908, Hatusima 1966).
Limonium wrightii (Hance) Kuntze (1891: 396)
Bas.: Statice wrightii Hance (1866: 236). Holotype:—JAPAN. Ryukyu Islands, Wright s.n. (BM!)

Description:—A shrublet with woody stems densely covered with dark brown rigid scales and leaves
congested on upper part of stems (Fig. 1A). The species has flower color polymorphism among populations
(pink, yellow, orange, ivory, and white; Matsumura et al. 2006) and the Philippines population had pink
flowers (Fig. 1B). Based on these characters, L. wrightii is clearly distinguished from congeners in the East
Asian Pacific rim, which are herbs having only basal leaves and yellow flowers (Peng & Kamelin 1996,
Matsumura et al. 2006).
Distribution and habitat:—The species has been reported previously only from Japan (the Ryukyu
Archipelago, Izu Islands, and Ogasawara Islands) and southern Taiwan (southern part of Taiwan Island,
Penghu Islands, and Lutao and Lanyu islands) (Li 1998, Matsumura et al. 2006). The newly discovered
population was in Sabtang Island of Batan Islands (the Philippines). The population grew on a raised coral
reef terrace at seashore (Fig. 1C), which is the typical habitat of the species.
Conservation status:—Limonium wrightii is listed in the red lists of Japan and Taiwan as a Vulnerable
(VU) and Critically endangered (CR) species, respectively (Ministry of the Environment, Japan 2012, Wang
et al. 2012). In Sabtang Island, the population of several tens of square meters comprised a few hundred
individuals. This is the only known population in the Philippines and isolated from conspecific populations in

Taiwan and Japan. Although Batanes Province is in its entirety a protected area (Sanga 2001), the very small
population is prone to the effects of human activities or stochastic events within a very short time period. The
species is here assessed as Vulnerable under Criterion D2 of IUCN (2010, 2012) for the Philippines.

25.45", N20° 18' 48.49", 19 December 2011, Nakamura 11922 (HAST).
