Abstract
Based on our detailed observations in the field, completed with herbarium material of representatives of Hydrangea
section Cornidia in southeastern Mexico and Central America, we found that Hydrangea steyermarkii Standley, in
contrast to what has been assumed up to now, is restricted to the Tacaná Volcano on the border of Mexico and Guatemala.
The majority of the specimens with reddish or whitish indument on their branches in South East Mexico and Central
America, belonging to this nearly exclusively Neotropical Hydrangea clade, had been identified as such, but the
characters of these collections do not coincide with the single type specimen of H. steyermarkii, neither with other
individuals of this species growing in the type locality area. In fact, nearly all specimens of Mesoamerica that had been
identified as this species belong to a new species with a relatively wide distribution, which we describe here. This new
species is illustrated and compared with H. steyermarkii, of which we also provide an amended description and
illustrations. Finally, on the basis of these two species we document previously suggested dioecism in this plant group,
which not only has consequences for systematics and nomenclature in this clade, but also for conservation.
Key words: Hortensia, taxonomy, Neotropics, functional dioecism, conservation

Introduction
The genus Hydrangea Linnaeus (1753a: 397) (Hydrangeaceae) is with more than 1,000 cultivars and hybrids
already since centuries a very popular ornamental plant group. These ornamentals with inflorescences with
attractive marginal flowers are commonly known as hortensias, and descend from Asian shrubby species such as
H. macrophylla (Thunb.) Ser. in de Candolle (1830: 15) and H. aspera D. Don (1825: 211). The Asian
representatives of Hydrangea have been relatively well studied although the species boundaries and relationships
continue to be disputed (Wei & Bartholomew 2001). Contrarily, the nearly exclusively American section Cornidia
Ruiz & Pavón (1794: 53) is very poorly known from any point of view, be it taxonomical, biological or ecological,
mainly because the available taxonomical and floristic studies are entirely based on the observation of fragmentary
herbarium material. All representatives are evergreen root climbers growing up to 30–40 meter high in the canopy
of mostly primary forests, with coriaceous leaves and hortensia-like whitish, greenish, yellowish or purplish
inflorescences, with our without marginal so-called “sterile” flowers. Their distribution area extends from northern
Mexico to southern Chile and Argentina with one species, Hydrangea integrifolia Hayata in Matsumura & Hayata
(1906: 131), in China, Taiwan and the Philippines.

According to several recent molecular studies, Hydrangea section Cornidia (hereafter shortened as Cornidia)
is monophyletic, including the single Asian species (Samain et al. 2010, Granados Mendoza et al. 2013a, b).
However, it is currently unknown how many species belong to this section as our recent field work across the
Neotropics has yielded new morphospecies which cannot be assigned to any known taxon (ongoing unpublished
studies). Since the description of Cornidia as a genus by Ruiz & Pavón (1794: 53) – later included as a section in
Hydrangea by Engler (1891: 76) – more than 40 taxa have been described in this group. The monograph of the
genus Hydrangea s.s. by McClintock (1957), which is entirely based on the study of herbarium specimens, is the
only available recent revision of this section and includes 12 accepted species, classified in two subsections,
Monosegia Briquet (1919: 396) and Polysegia Briquet (1919: 396). Although McClintock (1957) revised many
collections from the whole distribution area, it is obvious that this work oversimplifies the rather astonishing
diversity of climbing Hydrangeas in the Neotropics. Subsequent publications have largely taken over the
viewpoints of McClintock (1957) and also have been mainly or entirely based on herbarium material. Currently, 11
species and one variety are accepted in section Cornidia.
According to Christenhusz (2009) in the Flora Mesoamericana, the most widespread species in southeastern
Mexico and Central America is Hydrangea steyermarkii Standley (1940: 233), based on a single collection from
Julian Steyermark on the Guatemalan side of the Volcano Tacaná near the border with Mexico. However, our recent
field observations demonstrated that the collections made in Chiapas by Dennis Breedlove and his collaborators in
the framework of the project “Flora of Chiapas” (Breedlove, 1986) do not belong to Hydrangea steyermarkii, but
to a yet undescribed relatively widespread species instead. After detailed comparison with the type specimen, we
conclude that only our collections on the Mexican side of the Volcano Tacaná near the type locality of H.
steyermarkii effectively belong to this species.
Throughout its distribution area, Cornidia not only seems to be undercollected but also highly endangered
because of its occurrence in hyper-conserved primary forests, which are becoming rarer every day. For instance in
Mexico, our intensive exploring field work since 2009 revealed the presence of new populations which had never
been noticed before and which are already at risk. Moreover, the fact that these remarkable plants remained
undiscovered up to now is especially striking because of their growth form and size. As a consequence of their
exceptional dimensions, sufficient material for further study generally can only be collected using mountaineering
equipment, a technique which is rarely applied in botanical field work (Fig. 1A). Previous collections often seem to
be fallen branches where some floral parts have been shed already. As a result, the diversity in this clade has been
underestimated. To date, the last new species in Cornidia has been described 45 years ago by Nevling and GómezPompa (1968).
The aims of this paper are twofold: 1) presenting a description of the new Hydrangea species which has been
confused with H. steyermarkii and had not been recognized before, and 2) providing an amended description of H.
steyermarkii. Additionally, we discuss shortly the consequences for taxonomy and conservation of the functional
dioecism observed in this Hydrangea clade.

Material and Methods
Extensive field work has been carried out in the state of Chiapas in southeastern Mexico and in Costa Rica during
summer and winter seasons of 2011, 2012 and 2013, coinciding with the flowering seasons of both species.
Individuals were carefully observed and herbarium material and flowers and fruits were collected for further study.
Additionally, herbarium material of Hydrangea section Cornidia of the herbaria CAS, DUKE, F, INB, MEXU,
MICH, MO and US has been studied and compared with our own collections (deposited in CHIP, GENT and
MEXU, with the exception of the types which are deposited in more herbaria).
Material for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was taken from herbarium material and fixed to aluminium
stubs (especially made for the Instituto de Biología, UNAM) using standard carbon adhesive tapes (Electron
Microscopy Sciences), sputter-coated with carbon (20 nm) and gold (20 nm) under argon atmosphere using a
Quorum Q150R ES sputter-coater. Images were obtained with a Hitachi SU1510 scanning electron microscope at
acceleration voltage of 10 kV.

Habitat:ͶThis species is restricted to cloud forest (“selva mediana perennifolia” according to Miranda &
Hernández X. (1963), “bosque mesófilo de montaña” according to Rzedowski (1978)) with permanent high
humidity, up to 5000 mm rainfall, and high nubosity, on strong to moderate slopes of different geological
substrates, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. It occurs mainly on northeast-facing slopes, where the trade winds
strike, in conserved places or on disturbed localities near water streams.
Distribution:ͶHydrangea albostellata is characterized by a wide geographical and altitudinal distribution. In
Mexico it occurs in the north and northeast of the state of Chiapas, wherever the required habitat is present,
between 1200 and 2300 m above sea level. Interestingly, all recent collections are located between 1800 and 1900
m altitude. Furthermore, this species has been collected in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Costa Rica. It is
not known from South America.

typical brownish-reddish cortex which contracts and forms corchy patches. D. Abaxial side of young leaf with whitish stellate

Phenology:ͶIn Mexico, this species has been observed flowering from September to January and fruiting in
January only. In Central America, plants seems to flower and fruit throughout the year.
Etymology:ͶThis species can be easily distinguished from all other Mexican and Central American species
because of the stellate white pubescence on leaves and inflorescence branches (Figs. 2B, 4E). These stellate hairs
are partially caducous, which sometimes results in less notoriously pubescent leaves in dried specimens.
Observations:ͶHydrangea albostellata has a larger distribution area than the majority of other species of
section Cornidia. This is the only species of southeastern Mexico which had been collected by Dennis Breedlove
and his collaborators from the California Academy of Sciences in the framework of the project Flora of Chiapas
(Breedlove, 1986). Nearly all Mexican and Central American collections listed among the additional specimens
here studied had been identified on the specimen labels as H. steyermarkii. Three of the five specimens mentioned
as H. steyermarkii in the Flora Mesoamericana (Christenhusz 2009) in fact belong to H. albostellata. See Table 1
for a summary of differentiating characters between both species.
The different duplicates of Breedlove 29829 (see additional specimens examined for details) are functionally
female or male, with one specimen (CAS) being mixed. It is highly doubtful that they belong to one and the same
individual; leaves of functionally male branches of this collection are narrower and smaller than those of
functionally female branches.This is congruent with the 1994 notes on the CAS specimen of Elizabeth McClintock,
who worked in the same institute as Breedlove.
As can be seen from the description, the enlarged marginal flowers are not sterile as has been generally
assumed, but which we already questioned earlier (Samain et al. 2010). The description of the marginal flower in

this case is from a functionally female plant. The functionally male plants we observed did not have enlarged
marginal flowers, showing the intraspecific variability of the presence or absence of this structure in this species, in
contrast to e.g. H. seemannii from northern Mexico and H. asterolasia in Costa Rica and northern South America,
which always have whitish marginal flowers. Interestingly, we have also observed one enlarged marginal flower in
a functionally female plant of H. nebulicola in the Mexican state of Veracruz (M.S. Samain & E. Martinez S. 2011215), whereas this was not documented for the functionally male plants in the original description by Nevling &
Gómez-Pompa (1968).

The specimen Breedlove 24174 from Solosuchiapa, Chiapas (CAS) belongs to an unidentified species of the
family Malpighiaceae, of which juvenile forms have been confused with Hydrangea also in other countries than
Mexico, e.g. Salick & Stijfhoorn 8265 (MO!) from Boca de Sábalo, Nicaragua. Nevertheless, even in very young
stages, they can be easily distinguished from each other, as leaves of Hydrangea are coriaceous with a dentate to
serrate margin, whereas leaves of Malpighiaceae are membranous with a smooth margin. In addition, the specimen
from Nicaragua occurs at a very low altitude (± 45 m asl), whereas to our knowledge none of the Hydrangea
species in Mesoamerica occurs below 900 m above sea level.

Conservation:ͶAccording to the criteria and categories of IUCN (2012), H. albostellata should be
considered as endangered, but the current intrinsic threats of its habitat will soon drive it to be critically
endangered, especially as a consequence of habitat destruction. The population in the municipality of La Trinitaria
is probably extinct as a consequence of fires during the El Niño in 1997 and 1998. It had not rained since October
1997 for 8 months, when in May 1998 fires allover the state of Chiapas destroyed 250,000 hectares of primary
forest (Martínez, 2003). The annual precipitation in La Trinitaria then averaged 5000 mm, with daily rains, so it is
even quite probable that all plants died before the fires, as was observed in the region of the Chimalapas in eastern
Chiapas and in western Oaxaca (Silvia Salas, pers. comm.). The population in the municipality of La
Independencia could not yet be found, but it is highly probably that some individuals still survive in the remaining
patches of primary cloud forest. The population in the municipality of Pueblo Nuevo Solistahuacan has been
detected and seems viable, despite the fact that many mature individuals grow in primary forest areas near the
roads. During our exploring expeditions, new populations have been discovered in the municipalities of Tapalapa
and Yajalón, both in local reserves, guaranteeing their survival for at least some time. Taking into consideration its
current extensive but fragmented distribution area, it was probably once a relatively common species in humid
cloud forest from southeastern Mexico to Costa Rica.

in mature fruits, stigmas apically clavate and shortly penicellate, fruit a broadly semiglobose capsule, lateral ribs
cannot be distinguished because of the shriveled state of the fruits, dark brown, 3–4 mm high, 4–5 mm broad
above, 3–4 mm diameter, opening between the two pistils to release seeds, seeds not seen.
Habitat:ͶVery deep valleys in cloud forest (“selva mediana perennifolia” according to Miranda & Hernández
X., 1963, “bosque mesófilo de montaña” according to Rzedowski, 1978) dominated by Hedyosmum mexicanum.
This species gets easily established in primary forest on very steep slopes in ravines where there are recurrent
disturbances as a consequence of very strong winds which cause treefall. This species occurs in conserved
localities, as well as on disturbed places with very strong succession dynamics, protected from the humid winds
from the south, on igneous rocks, with approximately 3000 mm rainfall.
Distribution:ͶSouth-facing slopes of the volcano Tacaná in México and Guatemala, between 2200 and 3000
m.
Phenology:ͶThis species has been observed flowering in September and fruiting in February.
Observations:ͶThe population on the Mexican side of the volcano Tacaná near the village of Chiquihuite, 5–
6 km in straight line from the type locality, is the first record of this species in Mexico. Interestingly, the type
specimen belongs to a functionally female individual, whereas our collection is a male specimen. Despite extensive
explorations on the Mexican side of the volcano Tacaná, it has not been possible to encounter a female specimen.
In contrast to the description, which mentions as habit a climbing epiphytic shrub (‘frutex scandens epiphyticus’;
Standley 1940: 233), this species is a root-climbing liana.
Standley (1940), in the description of H. steyermarkii, mentions a dense reddish pubescence for the branches
(‘quoque pilis stellatis brunnescentibus laxe tomentosis’). Nevertheless, this reddish ‘indument’ is a mixture of
young adventitious roots and penicellate, stellate hairs. In contrast, the indument on the lamina is whitish on the
type specimen and all other studied collections.
The marginal vein is closer to the leaf margin than in H. albostellata. The apex of the leaves on the terminal
branch of M.S. Samain et al. 2012-009 and M.S. Samain et al. 2012-010) is acuminate.
The majority of the available herbarium specimens of Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua as
well as a few collections of Costa Rica bear the identification of H. steyermarkii. However, only the specimens
mentioned below coincide with the type of this species and nearly all other specimens belong to H. albostellata.
The number of stamens in the observed functionally female flowers is variable although the average number is
8 with 6 large stamens and 2 smaller stamens. When there are only 6 stamens, they are all of the same size.

Conservation:ͶCritically Endangered; known from one population with adult flowering and juvenile runner
shoots on the Volcano Tacaná on the border of Mexico and Guatemala, and five sterile, mostly juvenile collections
by Julian Steyermark from Guatemala, none of them recent. Monitoring of remaining populations in Guatemala
would be important for evaluation of the conservation status of H. steyermarkii in that country. On the Mexican
side of the volcano ascending from the village of Chiquihuite, several flowering individuals have been observed,
although only one functionally male individual could be sampled up to now, as a consequence of the quite
inaccessible extremely steep slopes. There are many runner shoots on this locality, showing that this population
most probably reproduces vegetatively. This area is located at approximately 5–6 km in straight line from the type
locality on the Guatemalan side which could not yet be visited. The Mexican (sub)population is suffering as a
consequence of habitat destruction and land use change, such as floriculture of Zantedeschia aethiopica (‘alcatraz’)
and Hydrangea macrophylla cultivars.

Discussion
Hydrangea section Cornidia in Mexico
Two endemic species of Hydrangea section Cornidia were known up to now for Mexico, not taking into
account the erroneous identifications mentioned above: Hydrangea seemannii L. Riley (1924: 207) from temperate
coniferous forests in the northern states of Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Sinaloa and Sonora, and Hydrangea
nebulicola Nevling & Gómez Pompa (1968: 231) from cloud forests and oak-Liquidambar Linnaeus (1753b: 999)
forests in the states of Querétaro and Veracruz, central and eastern Mexico respectively (Nevling & Gómez-Pompa
1968, Durán-Espinosa 1999, Pérez-Calix 2004). The current contribution doubles the number of Cornidia species
for Mexico, although it does not alter the number of endemic species. Hydrangea steyermarkii Standl. is a new
record for the country. The majority of the specimens of H. albostellata have been collected in Mexico. In contrast
to Central and South American Cornidia species (south of Nicaragua) where both species with whitish-greenishyellowish or reddish-purple flowers occur, all currently known Mexican species have whitish flowers.
Up to now, only one Mexican Hydrangea species, H. nebulicola, has been considered as threatened or
endangered since more than 35 years in one of the first ever contributions on plant extinction (Vovides & GómezPompa, 1976). Later on, the species was listed by the Mexican authorities as endangered in 1994 (NORMA Oficial
Mexicana NOM-059-ECOL-1994) and as threatened with extinction since 2001 (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001
(SEMARNAT, 2002) and NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010 (SEMARNAT, 2010). A Red List of Hydrangea sensu
stricto (see Samain et al. 2010) worldwide is in preparation in cooperation with Botanic Gardens Conservation
International, based on our field observations throughout their distribution area.
Circumscription of Hydrangea steyermarkii and growth form of Cornidia species
Hydrangea steyermarkii has been confused with Hydrangea albostellata and even with a repent Malpighiaceae
species from tropical rainforest. From our ongoing revision in Cornidia, it is obvious that the confusion around

• 193

species circumscriptions especially originated as a consequence of the annotations of McClintock on most
herbarium specimens, which have been used as the basis for the majority of subsequent floristic contributions (e.g.
Christenhusz 2009). Two additional factors that have led to this confusion are the fragmentary Latin description of
H. steyermarkii and the availability of only one (functionally female) flowering type specimen.
During our field work focussed on Hydrangea throughout the Neotropics, it has become clear that observation
of living plants throughout the distribution area of each species is essential to understand the full range of intra- and
interspecific variation in this clade. Obviously, a herbarium specimen can only grasp a fraction of the characters of
plants measuring up to 40 m high, generally flowering just below or above the host tree canopy. This size hampers
not only the collection of complete flowering structures, but also correct observation of growth form.
Indeed, previous studies and notes on herbarium specimen labels of the Neotropical Hydrangeas often mention
a shrubby or epiphytic form (e.g. Standley 1940, Christenhusz 2009). However, our field observations without any
exception show root climbing and lianous individuals rooting near the base of its host tree. Nevertheless, in some
cases the apical portion of the plant, protruding above the canopy of its host tree, or rarely above the rock wall on
which the plant grows, does show affinities to a “shrubby” growth form (Granados Mendoza et al., unpublished
data). We consider the root climbing growth form as potential synapomorphy for Hydrangea section Cornidia.
However, taking into account this character within the whole genus Hydrangea sensu lato (see Samain et al. 2010),
it is potentially apomorphic considering that several Asian species of Hydrangea section Hydrangea (e.g. H.
anomala D. Don (1825: 211)) and of the satellite genera of the tribe Hydrangeeae (e.g. Pileostegia J.D. Hooker &
Thomson (1858: 57) also are root climbers (see also Nevling 1964).
Sexual dimorphism in Hydrangea section Cornidia
McClintock (1957) proposed the hypothesis that Cornidia species might be dimorphic, showing specimens
either with undeveloped anthers or undeveloped styles. This hypothesis has been taken over by Nevling & GómezPompa (1968) who suggest such specimens to be respectively female and male plants, as in their description of
Hydrangea nebulicola Nevl. & Gómez-Pompa from the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Freire-Fierro (2004) in the
Flora of Ecuador also mentions functional dioecism for Cornidia species H. peruviana Moric. ex A.P. de Candolle
(1830: 14) , H. preslii Briquet (1919: 409), H. jelskii Szyszyłowicz (1895: 218) and H. tarapotensis Briquet (1919:
415). In the early nineties of the twentieth century, McClintock also has made new annotations on a large amount
of specimens of this group, not only changing identifications (without any further explanation), but also with more
detailed observation on this dimorphism. To our knowledge, these new insights have not been published anywhere.
During our extensive field work throughout the Neotropics, we have observed sexual dimorphism, although never
as extreme as suggested by McClintock (1957), because both anthers and styles are always present, but either
androecium or gynoecium is less developed and smaller than the other structure. In some species the stamens of
functionally female flowers are shed relatively rapidly; this might lead to the erroneous observation that stamens
are absent. Hence, our observations rather suggest functional dimorphism as observed by Freire-Fierro (2004),
although further studies to investigate this in detail are needed. As can be seen from figures 3 C, 4 D and 5 C, and
the descriptions above, functionally female flowers have a semiglobose receptacle which often enlarges during
seed development, large pistils with a penicillate stigma and anthers with short filaments with very small,
rudimentary anthers without pollen. The pistils also increase in size during seed development. In contrast,
functionally male flowers are characterized by a campanulate hypanthium, stamens with remarkably long filaments
and globose tetrasporangiate anthers full of pollen, and small pistils without receptive surface (see figures 3 F, 4 C
and 5 B). We have observed a few intermediate examples, although not in the species discussed above.
Consequences of sexual dimorphism for taxonomy and conservation
The often remarkable different size in receptacle between functionally female and male flowers has caused
some authors to consider both forms as representatives of different species and other authors to synonymize species
or to rank them as subspecies or varieties. In contrast, Nevling & Gómez-Pompa (1968) in their publication of H.
nebulicola describe the existence of functional unisexual flowers, although they merely encountered functionally
male plants. They mention a similar case for H. oerstedii Briquet (1919: 407) and H. peruviana based on
McClintock’s (1957) identification key. Hydrangea oerstedii has been considered as a variety of H. peruviana by
Freire-Fierro (2004: 34), and more recently has been synonymized with H. peruviana by Christenhusz (2009).
However, like McClintock’s (1957) revision, these contributions oversimplify the enormous morphological

variation in Hydrangea s.s. and it seems that the two taxa mentioned above belong to a group with many different
morphospecies distributed in Central and South America.
The presence of this sexual dimorphism, the lack of insight in its ecology and evolution and the overall gap in
knowledge about the biology of this group challenge our ongoing conservation work of these species in Mexico
and other Latin American countries. In their recent review of sexual dimorphism in flowering plants, Barret &
Hough (2013) discuss niche differences and spatial segregation of female and male plants, which we also have
observed in Cornidia. Additionally, Vamosi & Vamosi (2005) mention that tropical dioecious woody plants might
be more prone to extinction. Nevertheless, vegetative reproduction seems to be the rule in the majority of the
Cornidia localities, and despite the massive seed production, we rarely observe juvenile plants, even not in large
populations. In contrast, it is quite common to observe stolons, or runner shoots according to Nevling & GómezPompa (1968), on the forest floor between several host trees. It is generally impossible to follow these runner
shoots, but as already noted by these authors for H. nebulicola in the Mexican state of Veracruz, one individual
might climb several trees. As a consequence, it is not evident to define individual plants versus populations.
Although the two species described above as well other species we are studying might be locally relatively
abundant, they are restricted to the higher or even highest elevations in their respective distribution areas in cloud
forest. The pristine habitat with very specific topographical conditions and the mycorrhiza (own observations) they
require make them not only promising bio-indicators for this kind of habitat, but also highly endangered as these
forests become rarer by the day, because they are highly appreciated by local people for agriculture and cattle.
Additionally, logging for appreciated woods is also frequent in these habitats. However, the most dramatic cause
that might bring several of these long-lived species to extinction in the near future is the current and future
predicted climate change which is driving cloud forest species in eastern and southern Mexico towards upward
migration to higher elevation (Rojas-Soto et al. 2012).
To conclude, although in recent years our knowledge of the morphology, biology and evolution of this group
based on wild-collected plants has increased, much additional research in various disciplines is needed to build the
basis for saving some of these botanical “Lonesome Georges” from extinction.
