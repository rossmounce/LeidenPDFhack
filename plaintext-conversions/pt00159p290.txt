Abstract
A new species of Salacca sect. Salacca from Sumatra is described and illustrated. It is characterized by dwarf habit, with
leaves to 2.5 m long; erect and slender staminate inflorescences to 7 cm long; and small infructescences, to 10 cm long,
with up to 3 branches The most similar species, S. rupicola from Borneo, is different in having the apical leaflets
composed ca. 8 united segments versus 2 in the new species, and in having larger inflorescences, the staminate to 15 cm
long and the pistillate to 40 cm long.
Key words:Aceh, dwarf salak, Gunung Leuser National Park, section Salacca

Introduction
Salacca Reinwardt (1825: 3; Arecaceae, subfamily Calamoideae, tribe Calameae) comprises 22 species (Govaerts
et al. 2013) distributed from Burma and Indochina south and eastwards to Borneo, Java and the southern most part
of the Philippines (Dransfield et al. 2008) with the largest number of species and the greatest morphological
diversity found in the Malay Peninsula and Borneo. Although there are widespread species, such as S. affinis
Griffith (1845: 9) and S. zalacca Voss (1895: 1152), most of the species are restricted to very small areas
(Dransfield 2009).The genus is neatly divisible into two sections (Beccari 1918; Dransfield et al. 2008): section
Salacca with strigose ovary, hispid subspinous fruit, and pistillate rachillae bearing dyads of one fertile pistillate
and one sterile staminate flower; and section Leiosalacca with ovaries and fruits covered in smooth scales, and
pistillate rachillae bearing solitary pistillate flowers. Of the 22 species currently recognized, 20 belong to section
Salacca and two to section Leiosalacca (Dransfield et al. 2008).
In this paper we describe a new species first collected by J. Dransfield and D. Saerudin at Gunung Kemiri,
Southeast Aceh Regency, Aceh Province in 1971. The species was later recollected by one of the authors of this
paper (JM) who annotated the specimens with the name S. acehensis. However, the name remained unpublished. In
this paper we describe the new species and compare it to other small species of section Salacca.

m elevation,18 November 1975, J.P.Mogea 568 (holotype BO!, isotypes K!, L!).
Small palm, with stem to 15 cm tall and leaves 1–2.5 m long. Staminate inflorescences slender and erect, to 7 cm long, with up
to 3 branches. Pistillate inflorescenses to 10 cm long, with up to 2 branches. Most similar to S. rupicola J. Dransf. from
Borneo, but different in having the apical leaflets composed of ca. 2 united segments (versus 8 in S. rupicola), and smaller
inflorescences (the staminate inflorescence up to15 cm long and the pistillate ones to 40 cm long in S. rupicola).

ZUMAIDAR

Small, pleonanthic, dioecious palm. Stems clustering, ca. 10–15 cm long, 3–5 cm in diameter, somewhat stilt
rooted, obscured by persistent leaf bases. Leaves 5–12 per stem, 1–2.5 m long; sheath 5–6 cm wide at the base,
densely covered abaxially with dark brown indumentum, armed in the middle part with comb-shaped groups of
spines, each group consisting of 4–5 stout, triangular, yellowish spines, to 25 mm long and 2 mm wide at the base,
smaller spines present between the groups; all spines covered in indumentum, especially on adaxial side; petiole
slender, 75–125 cm long, ca. 9 mm in diameter at the base, 5 mm in diameter in the middle, triangular, covered in
pale brown to dark brown indumentum, especially in abaxial side, armed with scattered groups of short horizontal
and reflexed spines arranged in three longitudinal rows; rachis to 60 cm long. Leaflets 10–12 on each side of the
blade, irregularly arranged in groups of 2–3 near the base, spreading in several planes, sigmoid to lanceolate,
acuminate, margins armed with small curved spines ca. 0.5 mm long inserted at distances of 3–5 mm, pointing
upwards, adaxial surface dark green with sparse brown indumentum, abaxial surface yellowish grey, with dark
brown indumentum at the base and the margins; middle leaflets to 32 cm long and 6 cm wide, with 3 main
longitudinal veins separated by 1–2 cm and 4–7 minor veins in between, adaxially with transverse veinlets
conspicuous; apical leaflet 10 cm wide on each side, with ca. 2 main folds.
Inflorescences axillary, piercing the subtending leaf sheath. Staminate inflorescence to 7 cm long, slender and
erect, simple or with up to 3 branches to 5 cm long, with flowers borne in dyads, each subtended by a short
bracteole. Staminate flowers with sepals 3, membranous, ca. 3 mm long and 2 mm wide, basally united and with a
dense indumentum; petals 3, connate in the basal half, pink outside, basally white inside, ca. 2 mm long and 1 mm
wide; stamens 6, ca. 1 mm long, filament red, anther ca. 1 mm long with yellow pollen. Pistillate inflorescence and
flowers not seen. Young infructescences to 10 cm long, simple or with up to 2 branches, closely sheathed by
several peduncular bracts. Developing fruits globose, ca. 7 mm long and 8 mm wide (in dry condition), densely
covered with ascendent scales, ca. 3.5 mm long and 1 mm wide.
Paratypes:—INDONESIA. Sumatra; Aceh Province, Southeast Aceh Regency, Gunung Kemiri, near junction
of hill dipterocarp forest and lower montane forest, steep valley side, 1200 m elevation, 27 August 1971, J.
Dransfield and D. Saerudin 1983 (K!, KYO); same locality, hillslope of dipterocarp forest, 900 m elevation, 18
November 1975, J.P. Mogea 569 (BO!), 570 (BO!), 572 (BO!), 573 (BO!), 574 (BO!); North Sumatra Province,
Bukit Lawang Bahorok, Langkat, hill dipterocarp forest, 200 m elevation, 25 February 1973, J. Dransfield 3310
(BO!).
Discussion:—Salacca acehensis has the epicarp covered in spine-like scales and thus clearly belongs to section
Salacca. Among the species of that section it mostly resembles S. rupicola Dransfield (1980: 36), with which it
shares the small size, pinnate leaves and slender, erect, staminate inflorescences. However, S. rupicola has a
narrow, bluish green leaves with flabellate apical leaflets composed of ca. 8 united segments while in S. acehensis
they are composed of ca. 2. Furthermore, inflorescences of S. rupicola are larger: the staminate ones are up to 15
cm long (versus 7 cm in S. acehensis) and the pistillate up to 40 cm (versus 10 cm in S. acehensis). Salacca
rupicola also occurs in limestone habitats in Borneo. Of the remaining species of section Salacca with leaves less
than 2.5 m long, two species from Borneo, viz. S. dransfieldiana Mogea (1980: 463) and S. sarawakensis Mogea
(1980:473), and three species from Peninsular Malaysia, viz. S. flabellata Furtado (1949: 387), S. minuta Mogea
(1984: 11) and S. multiflora Mogea (1984: 13), have bifid, flabellate leaves. The remaining small species, S.
bakeriana Dransfield (2009: 168) from Borneo, S. graciliflora Mogea (1984: 6) from Peninsular Malaysia and S.
stolonifera Hodel (1997: 35) from Thailand, all have relatively long male inflorescences, up to 0.7–1.2 m long,
depending on the species, that are held along the surface of the ground and sometimes produce new shoots at the tip
—a character also found in S. flabellata). This has not been observed in S. acehensis where male inflorescences are
small and erect.
A duplicate of the paratype collection J. Dransfield and D. Saerudin 1983 was distributed to BO (J. Dransfield
pers. comm.) but was not found there in spite of thorough search.
Conservation status:—Gunung Kemiri, where this new species was first discovered, is part of the large, 1.09
mill. ha. Gunung Leuser National Park in northern Sumatra and hence protected area. The second known locality is
located at the eastern edge of that park, some 65 km E of Gunung Kemiri. The habitat is hill dipterocarp forest up
to an elevation of ca. 1200 m and Salacca acehensis may occur in large parts of the park. Data are insufficient to
perform a proper evaluation of its conservation status according to the IUCN criteria, but given the apparently
small total extent of the species’ range, and the high rates of deforestation outside protected area, it may be
vulnerable or even endangered.
