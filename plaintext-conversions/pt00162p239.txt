Radula helix was described as Jungermannia helix from a specimen collected by J.D. Hooker on Hermite Island,
Tierra del Fuego during the Antarctic expedition of HM Ships Erebus and Terror.
A century later Radula sainsburiana was described from a collection made by G.O.K. Sainsbury on Mt
Ruapehu in the North Island of New Zealand. Subsequently Radula sainsburiana was reported for Tasmania by
Renner (2005).
Radula sainsburiana specimens from Tasmania, New Zealand, and southern South American collections
attributed to R. helix share all salient morphological characters, including the paroicous inflorescence, the tightly
inrolled lobules, the yellow-green colour, and the habit of forming dense interwoven mats. The shared
morphological and ecological similarity of individuals from all three regions is consistent with membership to a
single species. Radula helix is so far the only Radula species having a circum-Subantarctic range disjunction.
The format of this note follows what is outlined in Söderström et al. (2012).
