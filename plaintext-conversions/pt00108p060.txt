Abstract
Hieracium crinitopannosum, a new species of presumably hybrid origin between H. petrovae and H. crinitum, is
described from the Rhodopes in southern Bulgaria and illustrated. It is similar to H. cappadocicum from Turkey, but
differs in the densely and conspicuously serrate-dentate leaves. The new species is triploid (x=9) and reproduces
apomictically.
Key words: Asteraceae, Balkan Peninsula, biodiversity, Europe, taxonomy

Introduction
In Europe Hieracium (Linnaeus 1753: 799) s.str. is dominated by apomictic polyploids (triploids and
tetraploids). Sexual diploids are very rare and with some exceptions (e.g. H. umbellatum Linnaeus 1753: 804)
occur mainly in refugial areas of Southern Europe (Merxmuller 1975). One of the most important areas of this
kind is the Balkan Peninsula, where diploid populations and even new diploid species have been discovered
recently (Vladimirov 2000, 2003; Vladimirov & Szel g 2006; Chrtek et al. 2007; Szel g et al. 2007; Szel g
2010; Ilnicki & Szel g 2011; Szel g & Ilnicki 2011).
The diploid, sexual Hieracium species are regularly accompanied by their hybrids. It is often possible to
find the second parent species nearby, that makes it substantially easier to identify the hybrid. Such a situation
may be seen in the Rhodopes in southern Bulgaria, where H. petrovae Vladimirov & Szel g (2006: 261), one
of the recently described diploid species, occurs. During field studies in the Central Rhodopes we found a
large population of the hitherto unknown taxon with the morphological characters intermediate between H.
petrovae from H. sect. Pannosa Zahn (1906: 69) and H. crinitum Smith (Sibthorp & Smith 1813: 134) from
H. sect. Italica Fries (1862: 7, 107). We decided to describe the plants from the Rhodopes as a new species.

Hieracium crinitopannosum Szel g & Vladimirov sp. nov. (Fig. 1)
Type: BULGARIA. Central Rhodopes, along the road from Devin town to Mihalkovo village, 625 m,

Paratypes: BULGARIA. Central Rhodopes, 5–6 km from Mihalkovo village by the road to Krichim
town, 550 m, 41°52'08"N, 24°25'07"E, 10 July 2011, V. Vladimirov (SOM 169413 to 169417, Herb. Hierac. Z.
Szel g).
Affinity: Hieracium crinitopannosum is similar to H. cappadocicum Freyn (1891: 55) described from
Turkey, but differs in the densely and conspicuously serrate-dentate leaves (see Szel g 2012: 356, fig. 6).

FIGURE 1. Holotype of Hieracium crinitopannosum (SOM 169412)

Description: Rhizomatous perennial. Stem 25–55 cm high, robust, 4.0–4.5 mm in diameter at the base,
villous-lanate, covered by subplumose, 8–10(–13) mm long hairs. Leaves 8–13, gradually reduced upwards
with conspicuously longer and denser indumentum at the base. Basal and lower cauline leaves crowded in a
false rosette, leaf blades 10–16(–22) cm long and 4.5–5.5 cm wide, ovate-lanceolate, broadest near the
middle, coarsely serrate-dentate, with 8–12 spreading teeth on each side, gradually tapered to a winged, 2–
3(4.5) cm long petiole; middle cauline leaves 8–11 cm long and 4–4.5 cm wide, ovate, serrate-dentate,
subsessile; the upper cauline leaves smaller, broadly ovate, dentate, sessile; all leaves with sparse stellate hairs
and dense subplumose hairs 2–3 mm long on the upper surface and sparse to moderate stellate hairs and dense

subplumose hairs 4–6 mm long on the lower surface. Synflorescence with 3–9(–18) capitula (and occasionally
some capitula aborted). Acladium 10–12 cm long. Synflorescence with 2–5 lateral branches, usually longer
than acladium, each with 2–3 capitula. Peduncles covered with dense, stellate hairs and dense, flexuous,
subplumose hairs 10–13 mm long. Flowering capitula 3–3.5 cm in diameter. Involucre subglobose, 12–13(15)
mm long and 14–15 mm wide; involucral bracts linear-lanceolate, subacute at apex, 11–13 mm long and 1.3–
1.5 mm wide; the outermost ones with dense stellate hairs, moderate to dense flexuous hairs 5–6 mm long,
and moderate minute glandular hairs 0.05–0.06 mm long, with membranous margin; the inner ones with wider
membranous margin, along the midrib with dense papillae and stellate hairs, moderate to sparse
microglandular hairs and flexuous simple hairs. Ligulate florets yellow, glabrous at apex. Styles yellow.
Receptacular pits with membranous, glandular-ciliate margin. Achenes 3.5–4.0 mm long, stramineous, with
yellowish-white pappus 6–7 mm long. Pollen in anthers numerous and of varying size.
Chromosome number: 2n = 3x = 27.
Mode of reproduction: Agamospermous.
Phenology: Flowering July and August. Fruiting until September.
Distribution and habitat: The species has been recorded in a few sites in the Central Rhodopes,
Bulgaria. It grows in places with open vegetation, e.g. eroded and rocky slopes on siliceous bedrock at 500–
700 m a.s.l., where sub-populations with several dozens to a few hundred individuals in each have been
observed. Occurrence of the species in the Rhodopes in northern Greece is likely.
Discussion: The geographical range of the apomictic hybrid taxa often extends outside that of the
presumable parental species. This is also the case in Hieracium crinitopannosum, which, unlike the
mesothermophilous H. petrovae, ‘left’ the deep, calcareous gorges of the Central Rhodopes and occurs in their
northern foreland in the Vacha River valley, where it meets the thermophilous H. crinitum, i.e. its alleged
second parental species.
Zahn (1938) placed the intermediate species of presumably hybrid origin between members of H. sect.
Pannosa and H. sect. Italica into the H. heldreichii agg. Determining the sectional placement of intermediate
Hieracium species (with parental species belonging to different sections) into one of the ‘ancestral’ sections,
although arbitrary, is useful from the practical point of view. Otherwise, the number of sections in the genus
would have to be increased at least threefold, with many of them monotypic. That is why we propose to
include H. crinitopannosum into H. sect. Pannosa as more closely resembling the morphology of H. petrovae
than that of H. crinitum.
