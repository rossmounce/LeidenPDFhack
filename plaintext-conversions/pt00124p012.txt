Abstract
Part of the definition of Psammodiscus is that there is always a small pore and sometimes a rimoportula present on the
valve centre. A new species Psammodiscus calceatus Tsuy.Watanabe, Nagumo & J. Tanaka is described, which lacks a
central small pore. And the valves of P. nitidus were found that have two marginal rimoportulae. Living cell of P. nitidus
attached on sand grain solitary and it has many discoid plastids. The structures of rotae with fin-like projections in
Psammodiscus differ from those of Rhaphoneidaceae genera. The epicingulum of Psammodiscus consists of three or four
open bands with the valvocopula and second band opening at 180° to one another alternately at one apex.
Key words: cingulum, morphology, Psammodiscus, Psammodiscus calceatus sp. nov., Rhaphoneidales

Introduction
Round established the order Rhaphoneidales to include two families, Rhaphoneidaceae Forti and
Psammodiscaceae Round & D.G. Mann (Round et al. 1990: 662). The family Rhaponeidaceae includes 13
genera: Adoneis G.W. Andrews & P. Rivera (1987: 2); Delphineis G.W. Andrews (1977: 249); Neodetonia S.
Blanco ( = Detonia Frenguelli (1949: 119); Dickensoniaforma R.P. Scherer (1997: 85); Diplomenora K.L.
Blazé (1984: 218); Drewsandria P.A. Sims & R. Ross (1996: 302); Incisoria Hajós in M. Hajós & H.
Stradner (1975: 937); Lancineis G.W. Andrews (1990: 128); Meloneis Louvrou, Danielidis & EconomouAmilli (2012: e32198, 2); Neodelphineis Takano (1982: 45); Perissonoë G.W. Andrews & Stoelzel (1984:
226); Rhaphoneis Ehrenberg (1844: 74); Sceptroneis Ehrenberg (1844: 264). The family Psammodiscaceae
consists of only one monotypic genus Psammodiscus Round & Mann (1980: 371), with P. nitidus (Gregory)
Round & Mann (1980: 371) as its generitype. P. nitidus was originally described under the name of
Coscinodiscus nitidus Gregory (1857: 499) as a radial centric diatom because of its circular valve and
radiating striae. However, C. nitidus is epipsammic and has areolae occluded by rotae without slits and small
sessile rimoportulae, which resembles of Rhaphoneis and related genera. Thus, C. nitidus was judged not to
be a species of Coscinodiscus but related to Rhaphoneis and placed in the monotypic genus (Round & Mann
1980). Part of the definition of Psammodiscus is that there are always a small pore and sometime a
rimoportula present on the valve centre. And it was known that P. nitidus has the rota with several spokes and
the cingulum consisting open bands (Round & Mann 1980).
Cells of Psammodiscus were collected from marine coast in Japan and observed using light (LM) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The object of this study is to clarify the morphology of species in the
genus Psammodiscus, as our examination of specimens from Psammodiscus revealed differences with
previous studies and some new structures leading to the description of the new species, Psammodiscus
calceatus sp. nov., which lacks central small pore.

Materials & methods
Samples of sand grains were collected by T. Watanabe in a few meters water depth at two locations: 1) beach
of Kume Island (26°20’10’’N, 126°49’42’’E, Okinawa Prefecture, Japan on 10 May 2006 and 14 September
2007, deposited in personal collection of T. Watanabe under the accession number TW156, TW159, TW166
and TW485); 2) shore of the Sea of Japan in Kutsu (35°45’24”N, 136°01’25”E, Tsuruga-shi, Fukui
Prefecture, Honshū Island, Japan, on 16 July 2006, deposited in a private collection under the accession
number TW229).
Diatom valves were cleaned following the method of Nagumo & Kobayashi (1990). Cleaned frustules
were then mounted onto glass slides with Mountmedia (Wako, Osaka). An Optiphot light microscope (Nikon,
Tokyo) with bright field (BF) was used to observe living cells and cleaned frustules. The confocal laser
scanning microscope (CLSM) Leica TCSNT system (Leica Microsystems, Heidelberg) with differential
interference contrast (DIC) was used to examine living cells and, with fluorescence, was used to detect
autofluorescence of plastids and DNA stained by 4’,6’ diamino-2-phenylindole 2HCl (DAPI) (Watanabe &
Nagumo 2006). For SEM, cleaned material was placed onto cover slips, air dried and coated with platinum
(Pt) or osmium tetroxide (OsO4) using E-1030 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) or NEOC-AN (Meiwa fosis, Tokyo)
coater, respectively. S-4000 and S-5000 scanning electron microscopes (Hitachi, Tokyo) were used for SEM
observations at an accelerating voltage of 3–5 kV, and 10–15 mm working distance.
Valve dimensions (length) were determined from digital images using the image analysis software LIA
for Windows 32 ver.0.376ß1 (http://www.agr.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~shinkan/LIA32/index-e.html).
Type slides have been deposited in BM and Museum of Tokyo University of Marine Science and
Technology, Tokyo, Japan (MTUF).
Morphological terminology follows Anonymous (1975), Cox & Ross (1981), Kobayasi et al. (2006),
Ross et al. (1979) and Round et al. (1990).

Discussion
Cells of P. nitidus were observed growing on the surface of sand grains, the first observation of the growth
habit of species in the genus Psammodiscus. Species of other members of the Rhaphoneidaceae – Rhaphoneis,
Perissonoë, Delphineis – are epipsammic (Table 1, Drebes 1974, Sato et al. 2011, Watanabe unpublished
data). The cells of species from Rhaphoneis, Perissonoë and Delphineis have several to many discoid plastids
(Table 1, Drebes 1974, Sato et al. 2011, Watanabe unpublished data); the numbers of discoid plastids in P.
nitidus is similar to those in species of both Rhaphoneis and Perissonoë. The epipsammic habitat and multiple
discoid plastids can be considered characters common to members of Rhaphoneidales.
SEM observations revealed the structures of areola in valves of Psammodiscus, showing pairs of fin-like
projections on rota, a structure not known in Psammodiscus. Round and Mann (1980) observed the fine
structure of rota, which has several spokes per areola and no slits. In all Rhaphoneidaceae genera, rotae
always have two spokes per areola and no fin-like projections with or without slit (Andrews & Rivera 1987,
Blazé 1984, Louvrou et al. 2012, Round et al. 1990, Sar et al. 2007, Takano 1982). Thus, it is suggested that
the number of spokes and the pairs of fin-like projections are taxonomically important characters for
separating the family Psammodiscaceae from Rhaphoneidaceae.

Furthermore, the epicingulum structure in species Psammodiscus, based on SEM observations, was
recorded for the first time. The following structural components of the epicingulum, present in both species of
Psammodiscus, characterize the genus: an absence of granules; all bands have a single opening and at least
one row of pores; the pores are occluded by rotae without slits having one or two spokes; the outermost band
has a single row of triangular pores. The cingulum of Psammodiscus has previously been reported that the
valvocopula (VC) is open with two rows of areolae, the gap in the open end of the band being closed by the
ligula of the second band, which is much narrower than the VC and nonporous (Round & Mann 1980). The
epicingulum of Rhaphoneis and Perissonoë consist of three bands covered by granules and have pores
occluded by rotae with slits (Watanabe et al. 2007, Watanabe unpublished data). The outermost band is closed
and, in Perissonoë, is ornamented, its edge has a fine sharp structure resembling a finely toothed edge
(Watanabe et al. 2007, Watanabe unpublished data). The epicingulum of Delphineis consists of four to five
bands without granules and pores (Watanabe et al. in press); the outermost and second outermost bands are
short. Thus, in the case of Psammodiscus, the epicingulum structure can help define a genus and variations
within it can distinguish species, at least in orders such as the Rhaphoneidales.

Psammodiscus calceatus is the second species in the genus Psammodiscus to be described. It differs from
P. nitidus in the following morphological features (Table 1): P. calceatus lacks the central small pore, which is
always present in P. nitidus; P. nitidus usually has one or two rimoportulae, whereas they are often absent in P.
calceatus; the density of areolae of P. calceatus is lower than that of P. nitidus; the number of spokes per rota
in P. calceatus is greater than in P. nitidus; the epicingulum of P. calceatus consists of four bands, while there
are only three in P. nitidus.

Round & Mann (1980) defined the genus Psammodiscus having always a small central pore and
sometimes a single small rimoportula near the valve centre. The change of the generic definition seems to be
necessary for specimens lacking small central pore and having two rimoportulae near the valve margin. The
morphology of the cingulum is similar in both species of Psammodiscus except for the number of bands. The
third (outermost) band of P. nitidus corresponds morphologically to the fourth (outermost) band of P.

calceatus, i.e. both bands have an opening and a single row of triangular pores. The common morphologies of
the cingulum, shared between both species, is a useful character for generic definition of Psammodiscus in
Rhaphoneidales.
We found that valves of P. nitidus with two rimoportulae had them located at 180° from each other near
the valve margin. Mann (1984) hypothesized that the ancestral elongate ‘araphid’ diatom was derived from
the circular valve of Psammodiscus by a gradual reduction of the sternum – thus proposing the
‘pseudocentric’ pattern centre hypothesis (Mann 1984, p. 123, Fig. 3b, c). In the family Rhaphoneidaceae,
valves of various species have two (or several) rimoportulae at each pole (Round et al. 1990). In P. nitidus, the
two rimoportulae at opposite sides to each other near the valve margin may be the vestiges of bipolar valves.
Thus, our observations support the hypothesis of a ‘pseudocentric’ pattern centre as primary evidence that
Psammodiscus is not a radial ‘centric’ diatom.
