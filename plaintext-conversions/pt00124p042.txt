Abstract
Described herein is a new species from high-elevation limestone outcrops in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental, closely
allied to Heuchera sanguinea, from which it is distinguished on the basis of 6 morphological characters (external flower
surface color and indumentum, petal color, petal shape, stamen exsertion, and overall flower shape) as well restriction to
high elevations and a geographical range restricted to the Sierra la Marta and Sierra Coahuilón.

Introduction
Heuchera is the largest by far of a series of North American endemic genera of the Saxifragaceae, with about
43 species. It is also the most widely distributed, occurring from Kodiak Island, Alaska, south to the Sierra
Madre de Oaxaca of southern Mexico, and from the Atlantic forests to the Pacific coastal bluffs within meters
of the sea. It has its greatest diversity in the western Cordillera, where it is well-known for its difficult
morphological patterns and frequent hybridization both ancient and recent (Wells & Shipes 2009, Rosendahl,
Butters & Lakela 1936, Soltis et al. 1991, Folk & Freudenstein unpublished). My own morphological
investigations have indicated that there is significant diversity within the genus in the mountains of Mexico
that has yet to be described, particularly in the north, owing to a high natural diversity and to the paltry work
that has been devoted to them in this area.
During recent inspections of Mexican herbarium material a highly distinct plant of restricted occurrence
has come to my attention, which is here described as a new species and placed within the subgeneric
taxonomy of Rosendahl, Butters & Lakela (1936).

Materials and Methods
Herbarium loans were obtained from ASU, BRIT, CAS, F, MEXU, MICH, MO, NY, RSA, TEX, US, VT, and
XAL, comprising 765 sheets of Heuchera from Mexico. I have reviewed types belonging to all species of
Heuchera that have been described from Mexico and the adjacent US, either in person, or where necessary
through high resolution digital images. The names that have been examined are: H. acutifolia, H. amoena, H.
halstedii, H. hemsleyana, H. leptomeria, H. longipetala, H. mexicana, H. minutiflora, H. orizabensis, H.
pulchra, H. reglensis, H. rubescens, H. sanguinea, H. townsendii, and H. versicolor. A phylogenetic species
concept (Nixon & Wheeler 1990), in which a species is the most restrictive collection of populations with a
unique combination of character states, was applied in the context of the most recent treatment of Mexican
Heuchera species (Rosendahl, Butters & Lakela 1936) to revise and delimit taxa.

Description:—Perennial herb, subcaulescent from a multicipital thick caudex. Petioles glandular-villous and
glandular-pulverulent, (1.5–) 3–10 cm long. Leaf blades (1–) 2–5 cm wide and (1.25–) 1.5–4 cm long,
orbicular to ovate, deeply cordate with a narrow or wide sinus, shallowly divided into 5–7 lobes with narrow
sinuses; teeth large and coarse, triangular to crenate and mucronate; adaxial surface sparsely to densely
glandular-villous as well as glandular-puberulent, abaxial surface similarly vestitured but the longer hairs
restricted mainly to the veins. Margin moderately ciliate. Inflorescences indeterminate scapiform thyrses
(11.5–) 18.5–45 cm long, the flowers rather crowded and becoming interrupted proximally, the bracts highly
reduced, rarely having a large leaf-like bract, the lowest pair of bracts subopposite, primary axis glandularhirsute proximally to glandular-puberulent distally; cymules 2–7 flowered, 1.5–5.5 cm long, monochasial or
often dichasial at the first branching. Flowers 5–7 mm long, external surface white aging to pale pink,
puberulent proximally and becoming strongly hirsute-glandular distally; hypanthia campanulate, moderately
zygomorphic, 2.5–3.5 mm long on the adaxial side, (2.5–) 3–6 mm wide; sepals rounded, (1–) 1.5–3 mm
long; petals 2–3 mm long, white, ovate-spatulate to rhombic-spatulate with a prominent claw, exceeding the
sepal tips, adnate to free hypanthium just below the sepal sinuses; stamens 1.5–2 mm, slightly or strongly
included, filaments adnate to free hypanthium about halfway between the base and the level of the sepal
sinuses, anthers ovate; closed true styles about 1 mm, stigmas capitate. Capsule 8–10 mm long, 4–5 mm wide,
ovoid, exceeding slightly the accrescent calyx. Seeds about 0.7–0.8 mm long, fusiform but somewhat lunular,
beset with short spines.
Phenology:—Flowering June–September (–October), fruiting August–October.
Distribution:—The rocky slopes of El Coahuilón and Cerro El Morro in the Sierra Coahuilón and Sierra
la Marta, along the border between Coahuila and Nuevo León just south of Monterrey, northern Sierra Madre
Oriental, Mexico.
Habitat:—Moist north-facing rock outcrops or talus slopes, mostly on limestone, 3250–3700 m,
subalpine or alpine zone. Alpine specimens much dwarfed. Some plants, including the type collection, are
reported from the pioneer vegetation of recently burned pine forests.
Associates:—Pseudotsuga menziesii, Pinus rudis, P. culminicola, P. hartwegii, Abies vejari, Holodiscus
sp., Salix sp., Quercus sp., Garrya sp., and Symphoricarpos sp.
Conservation:—Known from only an extremely narrow range of about 6 km in width; a possible candidate
for conservation listing, but field work is needed to establish the size and stability of these populations.
Etymology:—For Olga Lakela, whose dissertation work led to an exemplary and well-regarded 1936
monograph on Heuchera, the most recent such work to include Mexican species.

Discussion
Heuchera lakelae is represented by a number of collections from high elevations in a very narrow area in
northeastern Mexico, the Sierra la Marta and Sierra Coahuilón just south of Monterrey. Judging from the large
number of geographically representative specimens I have seen for the genus in Mexico, H. lakelae appears to
HEUCHERA LAKELAE SP. NOV.

be locally abundant, but quite absent outside the documented range. Specimens of this taxon to date have
mostly been identified in herbaria as H. sanguinea Engelmann (1848: 107), though a recent floristic list
(Villareal-Quintanilla 2001) for Coahuila lists the type collection as H. mexicana Schaffn. ex Rydberg (Rydberg
1905: 108), a plant to which it does not appear to be as closely related, and a few have been annotated even
more remotely as H. rubescens Torrey (1852: 388). One specimen collected by G.B. Hinton at TEX was
anonymously annotated “n. sp.?”, indicating that other botanists have been struck by its appearance as well.
Heuchera lakelae is assigned to the previously monotypic subsection Sanguineae (section
Rhodoheuchera; currently containing only H. sanguinea). Though H. lakelae is strikingly different in gross
appearance from H. sanguinea, they share a number of technical characters: relatively large flowers with
broadly campanulate, slightly zygomorphic hypanthia, relatively wide petals, included stamens, adnation of
the filaments to the hypanthium well below the sepal sinuses, and very short true closed styles. They are also
similar in their summer flowering (other Mexican Heuchera species bloom in early spring). Heuchera lakelae
differs from H. sanguinea by having the external flower surface white but tinged with pale pink as the flowers
age (as opposed to a vivid, darkening cerise) and strongly glandular-hirsute distally (rather than uniformly
glandular-puberulent or sparsely glandular-hirtellous), petals white, ovate-spatulate to rhombic, large and
showy, and considerably surpassing the sepal tips (as opposed to cerise or pinkish, miniscule lanceolatespatulate petals not exceeding the sepal tips). The overall flower shape of H. lakelae is squatly cylindrical or
very slightly flaring (rather than strongly flaring-conical). Variegation of the upper leaf surface, apparently
caused by a secondary thickening of epidermal cell walls, is polymorphic and common across the range of H.
sanguinea, but wholly absent in H. lakelae. The habitat is also quite different: Heuchera sanguinea in Mexico
occurs at 1500–2300 (rarely to 3600) m, whereas H. lakelae is known from 3250–3700 m and is completely
absent from lower elevations. H. lakelae is obviously close to H. sanguinea but it approaches the
geographically proximate species H. mexicana in having exserted petals and a pale calyx color; H. lakelae
differs from H. mexicana in having short included true styles, included stamens which are attached well below
the level of the sepal sinuses on the abaxial side, rather wide petals, and a broadly campanulate flower, as well
as a later flowering period (Table 1).
The rank of species is chosen because of the striking morphological distinctness between H. lakelae and H.
sanguinea, its apparent closest relative, in 6 morphological characters (external flower surface color and
indumentum, petal color, petal shape, stamen exsertion, overall flower shape) as well as an altitudinal
difference and parapatric distribution. On the other hand, I have discovered a few specimens of H. sanguinea
with flowers that are unusually pale in appearance, and therefore resemble the color of H. lakelae. These
unusual specimens occur near the tiny range of H. lakelae, a region in which H. sanguinea is rare and fardisjunct (about 600 km) from its more extensive range in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental (Figure 2).
Overall these specimens are strikingly variable, but they have in common with H. sanguinea larger flowers,
small petals terminating below the sepal tips, and inserted anthers; their flowers, while opening pale,
eventually darken to the cerise color of typical H. sanguinea. Pale H. sanguinea has been seen only from the
periphery of the range of H. lakelae: the lower slopes of El Coahuilón, the Sierra de la Nieve, Sierra de la Viga,
and Sierra de los Lirios, at higher elevations than typical H. sanguinea in the west (2700–3600 m versus 1500–
2300 m). The pale phase does not occur in the Sierra Madre Occidental. The typical forms of H. lakelae and H.
sanguinea are at a glance strikingly different and easily distinguished by morphology, and these unusual
specimens seem to fall within the range of variation of H. sanguinea in characters examined other than color.
Material of Heuchera lakelae (from Hinton 17912 TEX) has been included in studies on the
phylogenetics of Heuchera using molecular data (results in progress). It has not been possible to resolve the
relationships of H. lakelae to other species on the basis of molecular data owing to the difficulty in obtaining
more variable single-copy nuclear loci from herbarium material. The loci recovered, ITS, ETS, and rpl32trnL, are not sufficient to resolve the relationships of H. lakelae. However, two of these loci provide molecular
diagnostic characters: H. lakelae was differentiated from two collections of H. sanguinea (from the Dragoon
and Chiricahua mountains) and all other species of section Rhodoheuchera on the basis of a single base
mutation (ITS), and a 3 base pair insertion (rpl32-trnL), apomorphic character states in both cases.

Heuchera sanguinea

Broadly distributed in
Northern Mexico, Sierra
Madre Occidental and
Oriental.

The tendency of the external flower surface becoming darker pink with age (“rubescence”) seems to be a synapomorphy of
section Rhodoheuchera, but species differ widely in the overall amount of pink. The hypanthium tends to be paler than the rest of
the external flower surface.

The phylogenetic position of Heuchera lakelae seems to be as sister to or perhaps derived from H.
sanguinea on the basis of morphological similarity. It may have originated allopatrically when previously
continuous mesic habitats across northern Mexico were cut off by the aridification of what is now the
Chihuahua Desert. Current populations of H. sanguinea in the Sierra Madre Oriental may represent more
recent incursions eastwards, either through long-distance dispersal or more likely through migration corridors
created during a recent glacial maximum. However, some of the features of H. lakelae, such as flower size,
hair length on the external flower surface, and degree of zygomorphy, are intermediate between H. sanguinea
and H. mexicana. Since Heuchera is well-known for its propensity to form hybrids (Soltis et al. 1991 and
citations therein), it is possible that H. lakelae arose from hybridization between H. sanguinea and H.
mexicana, both of which are peripherally distributed very near its range. More data, especially using
molecular characters and cytology, are needed to resolve the position of H. lakelae and explore the possibility
of its origination by hybridization.
