Abstract
In recent years numerous authors have suggested various generic placements for the Crape Ginger but still no valid
available name has been published. I therefore give a short overview and make the necessary combinations.

Introduction
Crape Ginger is a widespread species from tropical Asia and widely cultivated and naturalised elsewhere in
the tropics where the rhizome is used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes. Until recently the species was
known as Costus speciosus (Koenig 1783: 75) Smith (1791: 249). When Specht & Stevenson (2006) proposed
to put the species in a separate genus the species became variously known as Cheilocostus speciosus
(J.Koenig) C.D.Specht (2006: 159), “Pyxa speciosa (J.Koenig) R.M.Almeida (2009: 113),” nom. inval., and
“Hellenia speciosa (J.Koenig) S.R.Dutta (2010: 152),” nom. inval. In total six genera and seven species
names have been proposed for separating the Crape Ginger from the genus Costus, none of which are
available and correct.
When Specht & Stevenson (2006) proposed a new phylogeny-based classification of the family Costaceae
Nakai, they published the new genus Cheilocostus C.D.Specht. As the type species they choose C. speciosus
based on Banksea speciosa J.Koenig (1783: 75). This last name is the only and thus obligate type species for
the genus Banksea J.Koenig (1783: 75), but as this generic name is a later parahomonym of Banksia
J.R.Forster & G.Forster (1775: 7), to which it is sufficiently alike to be confused and should be treated as a
homonym (Vienna ICBN Art. 53, 2006), it first appears that Cheilocostus is a replacement name for Banksea.
However, already in 1791, Retzius had published a replacement name for Banksea, namely Hellenia Retzius
(1791: 18). Consequently, Cheilocostus is an illegitimate superfluous name for Hellenia, which should be
taken up for this genus. Almeida (2009) took up the generic name Pyxa Noronha for Cheilocostus. This
generic name has however never been validly published and is listed without description by Noronha. Dutta
(2010) stated that the name was later validated by Miquel, but he merely mentions it in synonymy under
Costus. Dutta (2010) was however correct in recognising that Hellenia is the earliest available name.
Unfortunately he considered the name Banksea speciosa as illegitimate, and therefore failed to cite it (see
ICBN Art. 33, Ex. 20) as the correct basionym for his intended combination for the Crape Ginger under
Hellenia. Art. 55.1 (ICBN, 2006) clearly states that species names placed under illegitimate generic names are
not illegitimate themselves and therefore the name Banksea speciosa is the earliest legitimate name requiring
transfer to Hellenia.
Although it would be possible to conserve the name Cheilocostus, I feel it has been published too recently,
and both Pyxa and Hellenia have been used for the genus in the meantime. I therefore propose the following
new combinations. One other combination, H. globosa (Blume) S.R.Dutta (2010: 152), was already validly
published by Dutta.
