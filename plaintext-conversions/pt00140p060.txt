Abstract
A new species, Hoya nuttiana Rodda & Simonsson, endemic of Sarawak, Malaysia is described and illustrated. George
Derby Haviland and Charles Hose first collected the species in Sarawak in 1894. More recent collections were made in
1987 and 2007. Hoya nuttiana can be separated from all published Hoya species because it is the only known species
with globular inflorescences of up to 100 flowers with campanulate corollas bearing a stalked gynostegium.

Introduction
The diversity of Hoya Brown (1810: 459) in Borneo is unknown (Forster et al. 1998) and apart from Merrill’s
(1921) checklist of Bornean plants, listing eight species, and an unpublished checklist (Nutt 2001), no
regional revision has been attempted so far. Extensive fieldwork throughout Borneo will be required in
preparation for a comprehensive revision. Following the approach of Rintz (1978), Forster et al. (1997) and
Liddle & Forster (2008), sterile plants will have to be collected and brought into cultivation ex situ, where
they will eventually flower. However, years may pass from collection to flowering, thus delaying the
completion of a revision.
In the meantime, new Hoya species from Borneo have been identified based upon the examination of
herbarium collections, which remain of major importance for species discovery (Bebber et al. 2010) and from
cultivated plants (Rodda & Nyhuus 2009, Rodda & Simonsson 2011a,b, Rodda et al. 2011, Trần et al. 2011,
Rodda & Simonsson Juhonewe 2012).
Despite the genus being revised for Peninsular Malaysia relatively recently (Rintz 1978), in 2012 a new
species first collected 118 years earlier in Peninsular Malaysia, Hoya mappigera Rodda & Simonsson
Juhonewe (2012: 338) was described. Similarly, in the present paper we document the discovery of a species
first collected in 1894 in Sarawak, Malaysia by George Derby Haviland and Charles Hose (Haviland & Hose
8530, K). Pia Nutt (2001) suggested that the Haviland and Hose specimen may represent a new undescribed
taxon, but never published it. We here confirm Nutt’s identification and publish the new species as Hoya
nuttiana Rodda & Simonsson.

Taxonomy
Hoya nuttiana Rodda and Simonsson, spec. nov. (Figs. 1 & 2).
The flowers of H. nuttiana can be compared to those of Hoya devogelii Rodda & Simonsson (2011a: 35) because both
bear a pubescent campanulate corolla, a stalked gynostegium and a broad anther skirt. However, in H. devogelii the
flowers are smaller (ca. 1 cm vs. ca. 2 cm in diam.), more numerous (4–7 vs. up to 100 flowers), and the stalked
gynostegium is taller (column 2.5–3 mm vs. 1.2–1.5 mm).

Type:—MALAYSIA. Sarawak: near Kuching, 24 October 1894, Haviland & Hose 8530 (holotype K!, barcode
K000014447).

Vigorous lithophytic climber (fide Yii Puan Ching et al. S53778, KEP), with white exudate in all vegetative
parts; all vegetative parts glabrous. Leafy stems cylindrical, up to 5 mm in diam., dark brown or grey, with
membranaceous peeling bark; internodes 5–20 cm long. Petioles cylindrical, slightly channelled above in
proximity to the lamina base, 8–12 × ca. 2 mm in diam., lamina elliptic-lanceolate, coriaceous, (6.5)10–15 ×
3–6.5 cm, apex shortly acuminate or cuspidate, base acute, penninerved, main vein depressed on adaxial
surface, evident on abaxial surface, secondary veins 5–7 pairs, evident when dry, held at 70–85°,
anastomosing near leaf margins, tertiary venation reticulate. Inflorescences pseudo-umbelliform or globular,
ca. 10 cm in diam., up to 100-flowered; peduncles extra-axillary, terete, 8–12 cm × 2–3 mm in diam.,
glabrous; pedicels 3.5–4.5 cm × 0.6–1 mm in diam., pubescent. Calyx lobes triangular, 0.7–1 × 1–1.2 mm,
apex acute or round, glabrous adaxially, pubescent abaxially, ciliate; colleters 1(2), in each sepal sinus, ovoid.
Corolla campanulate, ca. 1 cm in diam., greenish-yellow (fide Yii Puan Ching et al. S53778, KEP), pubescent
throughout inside, more so on the lobes and upper 1/3 of the tube (long villous in Haviland & Hose 8530, K),
outside glabrous, tube 4–5 mm long, 6–7 mm in diam., lobes broadly triangular, revolute, 2–3 × 4–5 mm, apex
acute. Gynostegium stalked, corona column conical, 2.5–3 mm × ca. 2 mm (base) or ca. 1 mm (apex)
pubescent; Corona staminal, ca. 2.5 mm high, 5–6 mm in diam., fleshy; corona lobes apically oblong, 2.5–3
mm × 0.7–0.9 mm, inner process depressed, round, terminating in an erect, acute tip as high as the anthers,
outer process erect, narrowly round, basally forming a broad ‘anther skirt’ with revolute lateral margins.
Style-head convex, just shorter than the anther appendages. Pollinia oblong, with round apex and base and
evident pellucid margin, 255–280 × 110–120 µm; caudicles attached at the centre of the retinaculum, winged,
retinaculum 120–130 × 50–60 µm; ovary bi-carpellate, conical, ca. 2 mm long, each carpel ca. 0.7 mm wide at
the base. Fruits and seeds unknown.
Etymology:―Hoya nuttiana is named after Pia Nutt who first recognized the taxon as a new species
(Nutt, 2001).
Distribution area & Ecology:―The species occurs in three localities in Sarawak, Malaysian Borneo.
The type specimen was collected in an unspecified locality near Kuching in 1894. Two further specimens
were collected in 1987 on sandstone boulders at the base of a waterfall in the Hose Mountains (Yii Puan Ching
et al. S53778) and in 2007 in Pulong Tau National Park (Siti Eryani et al. S97648).
IUCN Red List category:—The taxon is only known from three collections, one of which poorly
localised (Haviland & Hose 8530), the others within a National Park (Siti Eryani et al. S97648) and a
proposed National Park (Yii Puan Ching et al. S53778), and therefore likely protected from local extinction.
However, the extent of occurrence and the population size are unknown, For these reasons H. nuttiana is
assessed as Data Deficient (DD) according to IUCN Red List criteria (IUCN 2012).
Additional specimens examined:—MALAYSIA. Sarawak: 7th Division, Hose Mountains, Ulu Sg.
Merarai Batang Balleh, sandstone boulders at the base of waterfall, 550 m a.s.l., 29 March 1987, Yii Puan
Ching et al. S53778 (SAR!, KEP!); ibid, Marudi, Pulong Tau National Park (western part) trail from long
Lobang to camp A, 10 May 2007, Siti Eryani et al. S97648 (SAR!, KEP, K, L).

Discussion
The morphology of the flowers of H. nuttiana is unique in Hoya. The only species bearing similar flowers is
H. devogelii that also has a pubescent corolla, a stalked gynostegium and very broad anther skirt. Broad anther
skirts are commonly observed in Hoya species bearing a campanulate corolla (Rodda & Nyhuus 2010). The
two species can be easily separated because H. devogelii has inflorescences of 4–7 flowers, broadly
campanulate corollas ca. 2 cm in diameter, and ovoid corona lobes, while H. nuttiana has up to 100-flowered

inflorescences, corollas narrowly campanulate ca. 1 cm in diam., and narrowly lanceolate corona lobes. In a
dry state, the coriaceous leaves of H. nuttiana can be superficially confused with those of the Borneo endemic
Hoya telosmoides Omlor (1996) that are usually smaller, (80)100–130 × (25)30–55 mm (fide Omlor (1996)).
The two species can be easily separated because the corolla of H. telosmoides is urceolate, while the corolla of
H. nuttiana is campanulate.
