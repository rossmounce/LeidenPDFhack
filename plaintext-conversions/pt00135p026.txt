Abstract
Four new species of Calamus (Arecaceae) are described and illustrated and compared with similar species.
Key words: Palmae, rattan

With its 374 species, Calamus Linnaeus (1753: 325) is by far the largest genus of palms (Govaerts &
Dransfield 2005). It is widely distributed from India eastwards to Fiji, with one disjunct species in tropical
Africa. The highest concentration of species is in the Asian tropics, especially in the Malay Peninsula,
Borneo, and Sumatra, with other centers of diversity in Indochina and New Guinea. The only monograph of
the whole genus is that of Beccari (1908, 1913, 1914). These monumental works are unrivalled for their
clarity and detail, but are now out-of-date. Although various regional treatments of Calamus have been
recently published (e.g., Evans et al. 2001a for Laos), there is no comprehensive revision of the whole genus.
Because of this, and its economic importance as a source of rattan cane, Henderson is currently carrying out a
revision of the genus. In the course of this revision, the following new species have been collected in Vietnam.
Calamus batoensis Henderson & N. Q. Dung sp. nov. (Fig. 1)
It differs from related species by its rachis bracts which are swollen at the apices and recurved pistillate rachillae which
have the dyads arranged in alternate rows but not opposite so one side of the rachillae is without flowers.
Type:—VIETNAM. Quang Ngai: Ba To District, road from Ba To to Ba Cung, steep slope in forest near road, 14°44’N,
108°53’E, ca. 600 m, 24 April 2013, A. Henderson & Nguyen Quoc Dung 3881 (holotype, VFM! isotype, NY!).

Stems clustered, 1 –10 m long, 0.5 –0.8 cm diameter with sheaths, ca. 0.6 cm without sheaths. Sheaths
greenish-white, longitudinally striate, not tomentose, with scattered, brown-tipped spines to 0.2 cm long;
ocreas short, membranous, early deciduous; knees present; flagella 72 cm long; petioles 2.5–11 cm long, spiny
along the margins and abaxially; rachises 12.5–30 cm long with 3–4, elliptic pinnae per side, these arranged in
remote clusters, the proximal pair oriented towards the sheath, the distalmost few (usually four) in a cluster
with the distalmost pair oriented away from the sheath and the adjacent pair oriented at a 45º angle to the
rachis, the apical pair joined for 8.5–12.7 cm, middle pinnae 15–26 cm long, 3.7–4.7 cm wide at widest point,
minutely spiny along the margins and with a few spines at the apices, not spiny on the veins. Staminate
inflorescences 76 cm long, flagellate, the first partial inflorescence subtended by the prophyll; prophyll and
rachis bracts tubular, swollen at the apices, just covering the bases of the partial inflorescences; partial
inflorescences branched to 2 orders; rachillae 0.5 – 1 cm long; staminate flowers not seen; pistillate
inflorescences 31–62 cm long, similar to staminate but branched to 1 order; rachillae 1.5–2 cm long; dyad
bracteoles obscure, campanulate, one side of mouth acuminate, visibly ribbed, the base free from the
preceding neuter flower and without an impression of its bracteole; dyads arranged in alternate rows but not

opposite, one side of the rachillae without flowers, the rachillae recurved; pistillate flowers 6 mm long (post
anthesis); calyx 2.5 mm long, tubular, lobed at the apices; corolla 4 mm long, tubular, with 3, valvate lobes at
the apices; fruits (immature) globose, 1.1 cm long, 0.9 cm diameter, 1-seeded; endosperm homogeneous or
scarcely ruminate; embryo basal.

Distribution and habitat:—Endemic to central Vietnam in Quang Ngai Province in secondary,
evergreen forest at 600 m elevation.
Local names and uses:—may rac. No uses recorded.
Additional specimens examined:—VIETNAM. Quang Ngai: Ba To District, road from Ba To to Ba
Cung, steep slope in forest near road, 14°44’N, 108°53’E, ca. 600 m, 18 July 2012, Henderson et al. 3808
(NY, VFM); same locality, same date, Henderson et al. 3809 (NY, VFM); same locality, 14 September 2011,
Nguyen Quoc Dung 2036 (NY, VFM).
Discussion:—In Evans et al.’s (2001a) treatment of Calamus in neighboring Laos, C. batoensis (named
for the district in which it occurs) would key to a group of three species: C. oligostachys Evans et. al. (2001b:
242), C. solitarius Evans et al. (2000: 932), and C. tetradactylus Hance (1875: 289), based on the presence of
a flagellum and strongly grouped pinnae lying in one plane. Calamus batoensis differs from all of these in its
swollen rachis bracts and recurved pistillate rachillae. In the course of a revision of Calamus (Henderson, in
prep.), phylogenetic analysis of morphological data comprising 110 characters taken from 3133 specimens
representing 316 species of Calamus, five of Ceratolobus Blume ex Schultes & Schultes (1830: lxxx), five of
Daemonorops Blume in Schultes & Schultes (1830: 1333), one of Retispatha Dransfield (1980a: 529), and
three of Pogonotium Dransfield (1980b: 763), with Plectocomia Martius & Blume in Schultes & Schultes
(1830: 1333) as outgroup, shows that Calamus batoensis is placed in a clade of 11 species, all from Laos and
Vietnam, characterized by the short, membranous ocrea. These are: C. oligostachys, C. solitarius, C.
tetradactylus, C. parvulus Henderson & Nguyen Quoc Dung (2010: 30), C. crispus Henderson et al. (2008:
191), C. dioicus Loureiro (1790: 211), C. kontumensis Henderson et al. (2008: 193), C. bimaniferus Evans et
al. (2000: 936), and two new species described below (C. flavinervis, C. quangngaiensis). Calamus batoensis
differs from all of these by its rachis bracts which are swollen at the apices and recurved pistillate rachillae
which have the dyads arranged in alternate rows but not opposite so one side of the rachillae is without
flowers. Although these two character states occur in unrelated species of Calamus, they only occur in this
clade in C. batoensis.
Calamus flavinervis Henderson & N. Q. Dung sp. nov. (Fig. 2)
It differs from related species by its densely spiny, tomentose leaf sheaths and distinctive, yellow cross veins.
Type:—VIETNAM. Khanh Hoa: road 653B from Nha Trang to Da Lat, 54 km from Nha Trang, 67 km before Da Lat, near
border with Lam Dong province, Hon Giao mountain, 12.180N, 108.733E, undisturbed forest on steep slope, 1000 m
elevation, 21 April 2013, A. Henderson & Nguyen Quoc Dung 3869 (holotype, VFM! isotypes, AAU!, NY!).

Stems clustered, to 8 m tall, 1–1.3 cm diameter with sheaths, ca. 0.6 cm without sheaths. Sheaths densely
brown tomentose initially, green, densely covered with greenish-yellow spines to 1.1 cm long, these
tomentose as the sheaths; ocreas short, membranous, early deciduous; knees present; flagella 190 cm long;
petioles 8–22 cm long, spiny along the margins and abaxially; rachises 38–60 cm long with 7–10, oblanceolate
pinnae per side, these arranged in remote clusters, leathery, with prominent, yellow cross-veins, the basal pair
oriented towards the sheath (especially on more apical leaves), distalmost few (usually four) in a cluster with
the distalmost pair oriented away from the sheath and the adjacent pair oriented at a 45º angle to the rachis, the
apical pair joined for 7.5–8.5 cm, middle pinnae 15–23.5 cm long, 3.4–4.3 cm wide at widest point, minutely
spiny along the margins, not spiny on the veins. Staminate inflorescences 300 cm long, flagellate; rachis
bracts tubular, terminating well below the partial inflorescences; partial inflorescences branched to 2 orders;
rachillae 2.5–4.5 cm long; staminate flowers not seen; pistillate inflorescences similar to staminate but
branched to 1 order; rachillae 2.5–2.7 cm long; dyad bracteoles obscure, campanulate, one side of mouth
acuminate, visibly ribbed, the base free from the preceding neuter flower and without an impression of its
bracteole; pistillate flowers 3.5 mm long before anthesis; calyx 3.5 mm long, tubular, lobed at the apices;
corolla 3 mm long, tubular, with 3, valvate lobes at the apices; fruits (immature) globose to ellipsoid, 0.9 cm
long, 0.7 cm diameter, 1-seeded; endosperm homogeneous or scarcely ruminate; embryo basal.
Distribution and habitat:—Endemic to southern Vietnam in Khanh Hoa Province in montane rain forest
on steep slopes at 900–1000 m elevation.

Additional specimen examined:—VIETNAM. Khanh Hoa: Khanh Vinh district, road from Khanh Hoa
to Da Lat, 12.200N, 108.733E, 900 m, 12 July 2010, A. Henderson et al. 3711 (IEBR, NY).
Discussion:—In Evans et al.’s (2001a) treatment of Calamus in neighboring Laos, this palm would key to
a group of three species: C. oligostachys, C. solitarius, and C. tetradactylus, based on the presence of a
flagellum and strongly grouped pinnae lying in one plane. Calamus flavinervis differs from all of these in its
pinnae with yellow cross-veins. In the same study of Calamus cited above (Henderson, in prep.), Calamus
flavinervis is placed in the same clade of 11 species as C. batoensis. It differs from all of these by its densely
spiny, tomentose leaf sheaths and pinnae with distinctive yellow cross-veins.
Calamus phuocbinhensis Henderson & N. Q. Dung sp. nov. (Fig. 3)
It differs from related species by its leaf sheaths without tomentum and with few spines, its rachises with recurved spines
abaxially, and its short, membranous ocreas consisting of two lateral flanges, not developed above the petiole.
Type:—VIETNAM. Ninh Thuan: Phuoc Binh National Park, near park headquarters, disturbed forest by ecotourism
trail, 11.986N, 108.747E, 323 m elevation, 18 April 2013, A. Henderson & Nguyen Quoc Dung 3857 (holotype,

Sheaths completely green, with very few, flat, brown spines to 1.5 cm long; ocreas short, membranous,
consisting of two lateral flanges, not developed above petiole, soon falling; flagella 165 cm long; knees
present; cirri absent; petioles 4–8 cm long on upper leaves, to 24 cm long on lower leaves; rachises 97–125 cm

long with 44–45 pinnae per side, these irregularly arranged in clusters and spreading in different planes, linear,
minutely spiny along the margins and mid-vein adaxially; middle pinnae 19.3–29.5 cm long, 1.2 cm wide;
apical pair of pinnae joined for 0.2–0.5 cm. Staminate inflorescences not seen; pistillate inflorescence rachis
bracts tubular, terminating below the partial inflorescences; flowers and fruits not seen.
Distribution and habitat:—Endemic to southern Vietnam in Ninh Thuan Province in seasonal forest at
323 m elevation.
Local names and uses:—may. No uses are reported.
Additional specimen examined:—Vietnam. Ninh Thuan: Phuoc Binh National Park, near park
headquarters, disturbed forest by ecotourism trail, 11.986N, 108.747E, 323 m, 18 April 2013, A. Henderson &
Nguyen Quoc Dung 3853 (AAU, NY, VFM).
Discussion:—Although the two specimens are incomplete and lack both flowers and fruits, and with only
an old, decaying inflorescence present, we have no doubt that they represent an undescribed species. In fact,
the sheaths and leaves of this species are the most distinctive and easily recognized of all Vietnamese palms. In
Evans et al.’s (2001a) treatment of Calamus in neighboring Laos, this palm would key to C. viminalis
Willdenow (1799: 203), based on its presence of a flagellum and irregularly arranged pinnae lying in different
planes. In the same study of Calamus cited above (Henderson, in prep.), C. phuocbinhensis (named for the
National Park in which it occurs) is placed in a clade comprising two other species; C. viminalis and C.
siamensis Beccari (1902: 203), characterized by the rachis with straight spines abaxially and the very short
staminate rachillae with the flowers arranged in glomerules. Calamus phuocbinhensis differs from both of
these in its leaf sheaths without tomentum and with few spines, its rachises with recurved spines abaxially, and
in particular its short, membranous ocreas consisting of two lateral flanges, not developed above the petiole. In
both C. viminalis and C. siamensis the ocrea is completely tubular and developed above the petiole.
Calamus quangngaiensis Henderson & N. Q. Dung sp. nov. (Fig. 4)
It differs from related species in its more numerous, regularly arranged lanceolate pinnae.
Type:—VIETNAM. Quang Ngai: Ba To District, road from Ba To to Ba Cung, steep slope in forest near road, 14°44’N,
108°53’E, ca. 600 m. 24 April 2013, A. Henderson & Nguyen Quoc Dung 3880 (holotype, VFM! isotype, NY!).

Stems clustered, 3–4 m long, 1–1.5 cm diameter with sheaths, 0.7 cm without sheaths. Sheaths densely brown
tomentose initially, green, densely covered with greenish-yellow, flattened spines to 1.2 cm long; ocreas short,
membranous, early deciduous; knees present; flagella present; petioles 18–44 cm long, spiny along the
margins; rachises 45–50 cm long with 8–13, lanceolate pinnae per side, these regularly arranged, middle
pinnae 28–31 cm long, 1.9–2 cm wide at widest point, minutely spiny along the margins, not spiny on the
veins, apical pair joined for 8.5–8.7 cm. Staminate inflorescences to 150 cm long, flagellate; rachis bracts
tubular, splitting near insertion of partial inflorescences or terminating just below them; partial inflorescences
branched to 2 orders; rachillae 2–5.5 cm long; staminate flowers 4 mm long; sepals 2 mm long, tubular
proximally, lobed distally; petals 4 mm long, valvate; pistillate inflorescences to 200 cm long, flagellate,
branched to 1 order; rachis bracts tubular, terminating well below the partial inflorescences; rachillae 3–6 cm
long; dyad bracteoles obscure, campanulate, one side of mouth acuminate, visibly ribbed, the base free from
the preceding neuter flower and without an impression of its bracteole; pistillate flowers 3 mm long before
anthesis; calyx 3 mm long, tubular, lobed at the apices; corolla 3 mm long, tubular, with 3, valvate lobes at the
apices; fruits (immature) ellipsoid, 1.1 cm long, 0.76 cm diameter, 1-seeded; fruiting perianths tubular;
endosperm homogeneous or scarcely ruminate; embryo basal.
Distribution and habitat:—Endemic to central Vietnam in Quang Ngai Province in secondary,
evergreen forest at 600 m elevation.
Local names and uses:—may. The canes are used locally in furniture making.
Additional specimens examined:—VIETNAM. Quang Ngai: Ba To District, road from Ba To to Ba

Discussion:—In Evans et al.’s (2001a) treatment of Calamus in neighboring Laos, this palm will key to a
group of clearly unrelated species; C. siamensis, C. tenuis Roxburgh (1832: 780), and C. godefroyi Beccari
(1908: 267). In same study of Calamus cited under C. batoensis (Henderson, in prep.), Calamus
quangngaiensis (named for the province in which it occurs) is placed as sister species to the clade including C.
batoensis and related species. It differs from all of these in its more numerous, regularly arranged lanceolate
pinnae.
