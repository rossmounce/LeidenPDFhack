Abstract
Previous knowledge of Cretaceous silicoflagellates has come primarily from scattered Maastrichtian or late Campanian
localities. Silicoflagellates from the earlier Upper Cretaceous have been observed from the southern shore of the Baltic
Sea and eastern slope of the northern Ural Mountains, and Lower Cretaceous from the Weddell Sea near Antarctica are
also known. Much of the previous work, including type specimens for genera and species, have been illustrated with few
and simple line drawings. Taxonomic distinctions and evolutionary lineages have often been speculative.
Recent studies of Santonian and lower Campanian marine sediments from several sites in the northern Canada
Arctic Margin and Archipelago substantially increase our knowledge of Cretaceous silicoflagellate morphology,
biostratigraphy, and early evolutionary history. This work, which develops from previous diatom studies, provides new
information on the enigmatic genera Cornua and Variramus, describes new genera and species, and presents new
information on the timing of silicoflagellate evolutionary events. Seven new biostratigraphic zones replace the
previously applied single biostratigraphic unit for the Cretaceous.
This article reviews recent silicoflagellate discoveries in the context of previous work to provide a current general
knowledge of the subject that includes important taxa.

Introduction
Silicoflagellates are single-celled heterokont algae with certain haptophyte affinities (Daugbjerg & Henriksen
2001). They are photosynthetic, exclusively marine, and in life are generally restricted to the euphotic zone.
Silicoflagellates are well understood and are used biostratigraphically in the Neogene though general utility is
less than that of diatoms or radiolarians due to sparser evolutionary events. Their skeletons are composed of
opal-A material that becomes unstable upon deeper burial (Littke et al. 1991), which reduces preservation
potential in Paleogene and Cretaceous sediments.
Silicoflagellates have an extensive and fairly well studied Cenozoic record with high and low-latitude
zonations for most of the era (see Perch-Nielsen 1985). Cenozoic skeletons consistently have a basal ring of
generally polygonal shape and constructed of more or less linear sides, that meet to form corners. Most also
have an apical structure built upon struts that attach one to each basal side. The apical structure and basal ring
give a general hemispherical shape to the skeleton. There are typically spines at the corners of the basal ring
and each side has a pike that points away from the apical structure (abapically).
The known silicoflagellate record begins in the Cretaceous, but the early history has not been well
understood. Until recently, this record consisted of six genera, one of which was problematic, and a single
formally described biostratigraphic zone. That zone and most known Cretaceous silicoflagellate taxa are from
the latest Campanian to Maastrichtian. Rare and isolated occurrences of older silicoflagellates were separated
by extensive time intervals where silicoflagellates had not been observed or studied.
Recently studied sediments have provided silicoflagellates within these previous gaps and new
interpretations of Cretaceous evolutionary history. These discoveries include new taxa and an improved
understanding of the history and diversity for all six previously known and two new genera. The number of

biostratigraphic zones has increased to seven. These provide an opportunity to reexamine the known
Cretaceous record in light of the new observations.

Initial studies of Cretaceous silicoflagellates
Silicoflagellates were first described by C. G. Ehrenberg in the late 1830s. Ehrenberg wrote some 20 papers on
them, for which he erected the genus Dictyocha Ehrenberg (1837: 61). Among the various species was
Dictyocha triacantha (Ehrenberg 1844: 80), which had three basal sides. The first to recognize the
silicoflagellates as a separate group was Lemmermann (1901), who described many new varieties of D.
triacantha that are now recognized as separate species. Lemmerman’s two pages of figures consisted of
simple line drawings with usually one illustration per new variety.
Cretaceous silicoflagellates were not discovered until 1928, when both Hanna and Schulz published
landmark papers. Hanna (1928) observed diverse silicoflagellates from the Moreno Shale of southern
California. He placed the three-sided skeletons into the new genus Corbisema Hanna (1928: 261), and
described the new species C. geometrica Hanna (1928: 261)(Fig. 1), which usually had an apical plate. This
genus, including C. geometrica, is also important in the Paleogene, which accounts for their previous
illustration by Ehrenberg and Lemmermann from Cenozoic sediments.
In addition to Corbisema, Hanna (1928) described a four-sided silicoflagellate skeleton as Dictyocha
quadralta Hanna (1928: 261)(Fig. 2), and the genera Vallacerta Hanna (1928: 262)(Fig. 3) and Lyramula
Hanna (1928: 262)(Figs. 4-5), neither of which had been previously illustrated. The genus Vallacerta has an
apical dome that is connected directly to the basal ring without the occurrence of struts. Illustrated pecimens
of V. hortonii Hanna (1928: 262) had five basal sides. Lyramula has a simple ‘Y,’’V,’ or ‘U’-shaped skeleton
made of two curved limbs that meet at an angle, perhaps with a spine.
Schulz (1928) was published a few months after Hanna’s paper and without prior knowledge of this work.
Schulz examined sponge “mummies” that wash out of a cliff on the then-German coast near what is now
Gdynia in Poland, and observed well-preserved silicoflagellates. The mummies were deposited as glacial
outwash and their geographic origin is unknown. Schulz observed both Corbisema and Vallacerta, which he
retained in the genus Dictyocha, but described the new genus and species Cornua trifurcata Schulz (1928:
285), which has three struts whose terminations bifurcate into basal elements that do not connect to form a
basal ring (Fig. 6). Schulz illustrated three skeletons of Cornua from abapical and oblique view that show
linear basal elements and prominent pikes.
Deflandre (1940, 1944, 1950) obtained a sample from Hanna labeled as "Diatomite de Panoche Hills,
Fresno County, Cal. (Etage de Moreno)," that included a variable group of silicoflagellate skeletons that
lacked basal rings, which he described as Cornua aculeifera Deflandre (1944: 464)(Fig. 7) and illustrated
with three line drawings. Deflandre emphasized that the skeletons were remarkably plastic, and that it was
difficult to find two specimens that were alike. Also described was Vallacerta hannai Deflandre (1944: 463),
which had small skeletons with seven basal sides and pikes that occurred on struts at some distance from the
base of an apical plate.
Jousé (1949, 1951) and Gleser (1959) observed Cretaceous silicoflagellates at various localities on the
eastern slope of the northern Ural Mountains. The silicoflagellates observed by Jousé are probably from the
early Campanian; those of Gleser are probably older and may age into the Santonian. Gleser (1959) identified
Cornua aculeifera, C. trifurcata and described the new species C. poretzkajae Gleser (1959: 110)(Fig. 8),
illustrating each with a single line drawing, though a few more illustrations were provided in Gleser (1966),
translated into English in 1970. C. poretzkajae has basal elements that bend towards the basal element of the
next adjacent strut and takes the general appearance of a Corbisema that is missing the corners. Gleser (1959)
also described Vallacerta tumidula Gleser (1959: 107), whose apical dome has a central area separated from
the rest of the dome by an incised trench.

The Cretaceous silicoflagellate literature summarized to this point represents the initial articles on the
subject, which describe four genera – Corbisema, Lyramula, Vallacerta and Cornua. Except for Hanna
(1928), all the silicoflagellates presented to here were illustrated with simple line drawings. Mandra (1960,
1968), Tsumura (1962), Ling (1972) and Cornell (1974) further examined silicoflagellates from the Moreno
formation of California and have separated Corbisema into various species, often elevating to species level
the varieties originally described by Lemmermann (1901).
More recent silicoflagellate study during the remainder of the 20th century can be quickly presented, as
there are few significant papers that introduce important new taxa. Bukry (1985) noted that skeletons of
Dictyocha quadralta Hanna (1928: 261) lack basal pikes and are not evolutionarily related to Cenozoic
Dictyocha and placed this taxon in the new genus Arctyocha Bukry (1985: 130). This skeletal morphology
had also been observed in the Moreno Shale (Mandra 1960, 1968), Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) Leg 29
Site 275 of the Southwest Pacific (Perch-Nielsen, 1975) and the CESAR-6 core from the Arctic Ocean (Ling
et al. 1973, Bukry 1981, Dell’Agnese & Clark 1994).

Silicoflagellates from the Lower Cretaceous were observed by McCartney et al. (1990), who describe a
Lower Cretaceous, Albian age, flora that occur in a short interval of Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 113
Site 693 of the Weddell Sea near Antarctica. The silicoflagellate flora consisted of small seven-sided
Vallacerta hannai very similar to those of Deflandre (1944) and an extremely variable group similar to
Cornua aculeifera illustrated in the same paper. The new genus Variramus McCartney, Wise, Harwood &
Gersonde (1990: 432) included most of the morphological variation into V. aculeifera (Deflandre) McCartney,
Wise, Harwood & Gersonde (1990: 432), with quadrate skeletons placed in the new species V. loperi
McCartney, Wise, Harwood & Gersonde (1990: 432).
Of the six Cretaceous genera presented thus far, Cornua was particularly enigmatic as the few illustrations
provided little detail and information was scanty. While Cornua had been reported in a few studies (Bukry
1974, Quinterno et al. 1994, Desikachary & Prema 1996) since the work of Gleser, these were present in very
low numbers and not accompanied by good photographs; it is uncertain that any of these later occurrences are
actually Cornua. Lipps (1970), in a review article, believed that the illustrated Cornua might be sponge
spicules while McCartney (1987) thought that they could be teratoid Corbisema.
The three periods of time where silicoflagellates had been observed and studied – the Maastrichtian,
Santonian\early Campanian and Aptian - are separated by two lengthy time intervals. The youngest of these
intervals includes most of the Campanian. While the precise stratigraphic position of the Schulz (1928) and
Gleser (1959) studies are unknown, these probably straddle the Santonian and earliest Campanian. Some of
the later Cretaceous studies, especially those where Arctyocha are present, include the latest Campanian. Most
of the Campanian, which spanned about 13 myr, had not been examined for silicoflagellates. The second and
more lengthy gap in the known silicoflagellate record extends from the Albian to Santonian, or about 25 myr.

Recent discoveries
Recent work on sediments from northern Canada provides information from these previously unstudied
intervals. These discoveries develop from two Masters theses that investigated diatom history during the
Santonian and Campanian. Tapia (1996) and Tapia & Harwood (2002) examined sediments from the Horton
River near the northern coast of Canada and several islands of the Canadian Archipelago, while Witkowski
(2008), Chin et al. (2008) and Witkowski et al. (2011) studied sediments from Devon Island in the Canadian
High Arctic. These sediments have extraordinarily well preserved silicoflagellates of unusual skeletal
morphologies, and include the first Cornua trifurcata to be photographed (Fig. 9).
The Horton River site spans nearly the entire Campanian. The highest portion of this sequence contains a
flora consistent with the Lyramula furcula Zone described by Bukry & Foster (1974), which was previously
the only silicoflagellate zone of the Cretaceous. Near the bottom of this sequence are sediments that contain
abundant Cornua trifurcata, which are used to define the C. trifurcata Partial Range Zone (McCartney et al.
2011a). The top of this zone is defined as the last abundant—and probable extinction—of the nominative
taxon. Immediately above the C. trifurcata Zone is a depauperate interval that lacks Cornua, described as the
Lyramula minor Interval Zone, characterized by a predominance of Lyramula minor (Deflandre) Deflandre
(1950: 62). The general small size of the silicoflagellates and unusual morphologies of both Lyramula and
Corbisema suggest that this zone may represent an environmentally stressed interval of time that followed the
extinction of much of the previous silicoflagellate flora (McCartney et al. 2011a).
Above the Lyramula minor Interval Zone are two zones named after species of Arctyocha. The oldest of
these is the Arctyocha mesocena Range Zone, which has abundant specimens of two new Arctyocha species:
A. balkwillii McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011a: 68) has basal rings with six to twelve or more sides
and a wide range of apical designs while A. mesocena McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011a: 69) lacks
an apical structure (Fig. 10). Above this zone is the A. quadralta Range Zone; the other Late Cretaceous
occurrences that have common A. quadralta, in California, the CESAR-6 core and DSDP Site 275, may
correlate with this interval.

The Arctyocha mesocena Zone also shows an evolutionary transition for Corbisema lateradiata (Schulz)
Perch-Nielsen (1975: 686) through C. geometrica Hanna (1928: 261) to C. parallela Hajós & Stradner (1975:
938), which is a trend to larger and rounder basal rings and apical plates. These skeletal morphologies were
previously known in the Maastrichtian, without knowledge as to which was the more primitive. Deflandre
(1940) thought that C. geometrica was as long-lived species that through expansion of the apical plates had
given rise to Vallacerta. The Horton interval showed that C. geometrica was a later development from a more
trigonal basal ring with pointed corners. All three corbisemid morphologies continue into the Paleogene.
The Devon Island interval is interpreted as Santonian to early Campanian in age and contains well
preserved silicoflagellates of three assemblages, each described as a zone (McCartney et al. 2011b). The
youngest of these is the Cornua trifurcata Zone described in McCartney et al. (2011a). Below this zone are
two assemblages of very unusual and previously undescribed silicoflagellates. These are the Schulzyocha
ruppelii Range Zone and below that the Vallacerta tumidula Partial Range Zone.

The Schulzyocha ruppelii Range Zone is characterized by the occurrence of several species of the new
genus Schulzyocha (McCartney et al. 2011b: 50). The type species of this genus is S. loperi (McCartney,
Wise, Harwood & Gersonde) McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 51)(Fig. 11), described by
McCartney et al. (1990) as a species of Variramus. The nominative species of the zone is Schulzyocha ruppelii
McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 52), an extremely unusual silicoflagellate with bulbs (Fig. 12) at
the ends of the struts. The zone includes five new species of this genus, including S. lurveyi McCartney,
Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 51)(Fig. 13), which has very unusual basal elements. All of the new
Schulzyocha species are restricted to the Schulzyocha ruppelii Zone. The Schulzyocha ruppelii Zone also has
in its bottommost sample the oldest known occurrence of Lyramula, which does not occur in the underlying
zone.
The Vallacerta tumidula Partial Range Zone includes a variety of especially unusual taxa, even by the
standards established by the Schulzyocha ruppelii Zone. The most unusual of these is the new genus
Umpiocha McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 52), which is characterized by long limbs that curve
beneath the apical structure, with terminations that come near to touching. The four curved limbs are not
connected to an obvious basal plane, with a general shape that is more spherical than all known
silicoflagellates except the Neogene Cannopilus Haeckel (1887: 1567). Two species have been placed in
Umpiocha; U. umpiana McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 53)(Fig. 14) has two rows of spines on
the limbs while U. jeletskyi McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 53)(Fig. 15) lacks spines but has
digitated terminations to the limbs.
The Vallacerta tumidula Partial Range Zone also includes an unusual new species of Cornua. The struts
of C. tapiae McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 49)(Fig. 16) terminate in basal elements that are
twisted and do not occur in a planar surface as do the basal elements of previously described Cornua. A
similar twist is repeated at the end of each strut, producing a “pinwheel” effect. The Cornua have considerable
variability and has been observed during recent reexamination of the ODP Site 693 material (McCartney et al.
2011a), making this and Variramus wisei McCartney, Witkowski & Harwood (2011b: 55)(Fig. 17) especially
long-lived Cretaceous silicoflagellate species.

Discussion
The silicoflagellate literature is briefly summarized in Table 1. Both the Horton River and Devon Island floras
provide a broader context for interpreting silicoflagellates of the Cretaceous. The base of the Horton River
section provides the first Cornua trifurcata assemblage observed in half a century, and the first ever to be
extensively documented photographically. This, combined with the older flora of Devon Island and ODP Site
693, represents an archaic group of silicoflagellates of which only Vallacerta has a basal ring. The other
archaic genera are Variramus, Cornua, Schulzyocha and Umpiocha, all of which lack a basal ring.
With the exception of Vallacerta, this archaic silicoflagellate flora either becomes extinct or very much
less abundant at the top of the C. trifurcata Zone, in the early Campanian. The overlying Lyramula minor
Zone has a depauperate flora dominated by small and unusual Lyramula. If this zone does represent recovery
following a silicoflagellate mass extinction, the recovery was rapid as the zone occurs in only a single sample
in the Horten River section. Rapid diversification followed with the evolution of Arctyocha and appearance of
plated Corbisema in the next higher zone.
Arctyocha and Corbisema, combined with Lyramula and Vallacerta, form the late Campanian/
Maastrichtian flora that has been the subject of most of Cretaceus silicoflagellate literature. The previous
literature, however, does not discuss the many-sided Arctyocha and the diverse morphologies that lack an
apical structure observed in the Horton River section. This record shows a trend for Arctyocha towards fewer
basal sides and less complex apical structures as the Campanian proceeds. Four-sided Arctyocha
morphologies are most typical near the Campanian/Maastrichtian boundary. It is uncertain if and for how long
the genus persists into the Maastrichtian, but it is generally not present in exclusively Maastrichtian sections.

At about the time that Arctyocha diminishes in abundance, more complex Lyramula morphologies with three
to many limbs and less symmetrical skeletons occur. Complex Lyramula skeletons were illustrated by
Deflandre (1940, 1950) and also observed in section 2–5 of DSDP Site 275 (Bukry 1975) and the CESAR-6
core (Bukry 1981). Unusual Arctyocha morphologies that have struts that support an apical window have also
been observed in the late Campanian (Harwood 1988, McCartney et al. 2010b). A detailed examination of the
California and Site 275 sections is needed to determine if these transitions are correlated with other evidence
of environmental stress.
Despite the many papers that include observations of silicoflagellates in the Maastrichtian, few
generalizations can be made about the nature of that record. No near complete record of Maastrichtian
silicoflagellate history is available, as can be observed at Horton River for the Campanian. Except for the
section at Seymour Island (Harwood 1988), little information is available about the impact of the terminal
Cretaceous extinction event on the silicoflagellates. If any of the Cretaceous silicoflagellate genera except
Corbisema survived the K\Pg boundary, they did not persist for long. All Cenozoic silicoflagellates evolved
from Corbisema.

Priorities for future study
The recent discoveries provide a new context for the interpretation of Cretaceous silicoflagellate history.
Many of the localities studied in past decades now require new and more detailed examination. Among these
is the Moreno formation of California, which has seen little study since Cornell (1974). None of the previous
studies were systematic examinations of stratigraphic sections with a high resolution sample interval. The
Horton River zonation suggests that the Arctyocha of California may be of latest Campanian age, and not
Maastrichtian as generally stated in the Californian silicoflagellate studies.
The presence of unusual Arctyocha and Lyramula near the bottom of core 2 at DSDP Site 275 also needs
further study. The Initial Scientific Results for that leg include three silicoflagellates studies (Bukry 1975,
Hajós & Stradner 1975, Perch-Nielsen 1975) which have different species interpretations. Corbisema
geometrica v. apiculata Jousé (1951: 78) of Hajós & Stradner (1975) is equivalent to C. lateradiata (PerchNielsen 1975) and C. geometrica lateradiata (Schulz) Bukry (1975: 853). Such disparities of Corbisema
interpretation occur throughout the Maastrichtian literature. There are also differences in the interpretation of
Corbisema taxa (C. apiculata Frenguelli (1940: 62), C. inermis (Lemmermann) Bukry (1975: 854), C.
archangelskiana (Schulz) Frenguelli (1940: 62)) between the Maastrichtian and Paleogene literature (e.g.,
McCartney et al. 2011b, for a discussion of C. inermis). Corbisema requires a thorough study to develop a
more consistent species interpretation.
The Devon Island section also deserves much more detailed analysis. The original samples were collected
during an exploratory search for fossil vertebrates, so a systematic sampling for microfossil study was not
made. The three zones interpreted by McCartney et al. (2011b) were made on the basis of eight samples (three
samples for each of the higher two zones, two samples in the lowest zone). Another expedition to this island to
obtain more samples would provide a better understanding of the early evolution of Corbisema, as well are the
diversification and variability of Cornua and Schulzyocha.
The Devon Island section also provides a better knowledge of Variramus, with three new species which
considerably narrow the interpretation of V. aculeifera as presented by McCartney et al. (1990). The Albian
section of ODP Site 693 needs to be restudied. A reexamination of Site 693 materials has observed Cornua
tapiae in the Albian. With the reclassification of V. loperi to Schulzyocha, the known Albian diversity has
increased from two Variramus and one Vallacerta species to four genera – Variramus, Vallacerta, Schulzyocha
and Cornua – the first of these now having several species.
Work is also needed to determine the provenance of the original sample studied by Deflandre (1940,
1944) from which Vallacerta hannai and what was then called Cornua aculeifera were described. Deflandre
obtained this sample from Hanna, who labeled it as Maastrichtian in age, and from a Panoche Hills section of
the Moreno formation. Deflandre however described a flora that is very similar to the Albian ODP Site 693
occurrence. If, as appears likely, the locality information was either mislabeled by Hanna or Deflandre, then
Where did it come from? Could an unknown Lower Cretaceous silicoflagellate-bearing unit of strata be
present in California or elsewhere?
Finally, more work needs to be done on any basic differences between the Cretaceous and Cenozoic
silicoflagellate flora. A rare double skeleton of Corbisema was found in the Horton River section and
illustrated by McCartney et al. (2010a). This specimen shows each skeleton of the pair rotated with respect to
the other, in a “star-of-David” configuration. Double skeleton specimens of Vallacerta and Schulzyocha also
show this rotated pattern (McCartney et al. 2010b, 2011b). Thus far, all observed double skeletons from the
Cretaceous show rotated double skeletons while Cenozoic double skeletons have the basal corners and spines
aligned with each other. Why would Cretaceous and Cenozoic double skeletons be so different? There is still
a great deal to learn about the Cretaceous and early Cenozoic silicoflagellate record.

Conclusions
During the past century, a variety of workers have observed and illustrated silicoflagellate skeletal
morphologies from the Cretaceous. This body of work started with Lemmermann, who in 1901 described
Paleogene taxa that are now commonly used for Cretaceous species of Corbisema. Hanna and Schulz in 1928
formally described three additional Cretaceous genera, and illustrated the Cretaceous morphology now known
as Arctyocha. Subsequent work through the 1980s have added to the knowledge of these genera through the
description of new species and extending their known geographic distributions.
The geologic record of Cretaceous silicoflagellates, however, was not appreciably extended by the
subsequent work, as the geologic age of known silicoflagellates continued to be latest Campanian through
Maastrichtian, and a relatively brief interval in the Santonian to earliest Campanian. In 1990, the discovery of
an assemblage of early and variable silicoflagellates from the Albian extended the known silicoflagellate
record considerably, but did not clarify the evolutionary relationships among the previously known genera.
More recent research in the Canadian Arctic provides a better understanding of early silicoflagellates. Cornua
is now known to be an important and long-lived genus. The transition from Cornua to Corbisema can now be
better placed temporally, and may involve two lineages. An evolutionary lineage is now available for the
Corbisema with apical plates. Dates of first appearance are now known for Lyramula and Arctyocha, and
unusual new silicoflagellates have been described in the Santonian. This information provides a larger context
and new perspective for interpretation of the previously known taxa.
