Abstract
Botanical gardens have several aims, among which is to increase awareness of plant diversity, to study it, and to conserve
it. The Francisco Javier Clavijero Botanical Garden at the Instituto de Ecología, in Xalapa, Mexico, curates the Mexican
national living national bamboo collection. In 2010 a new Otatea species was collected, described and cultivated in the
living bamboo collection. Two years after being planted, this bamboo began to flower in the summer of 2012. I decided
to visit the type locality and I found the entire population flowering. Based on collected specimens, the synflorescences
and spikelets of Otatea ramirezii are described and these structures are compared with those of the known Otatea species
described with flowers. The living national bamboo collection of Mexico is important for the preservation of native
species and, given that the flowering cycles of most bamboo species are not known, for the documentation of their life
cycles.

Resumen
Los jardines botánicos tienen diversos objetivos, uno de ellos es aumentar la conciencia, la investigación y la
conservación de biodiversidad vegetal. El jardín botánico Francisco Javier Clavijero en el Instituto de Ecología, en
Xalapa, México, resguarda la colección nacional de bambúes Mexicanos. En 2010 se colectó, describió y cultivó una
especie nueva de Otatea en la colección nacional de bambúes. Después de dos años de crecimiento, el bambú comenzó a
florecer en el verano de 2012. Decidí visitar la localidad tipo y encontré a toda la población floreciendo. Con base en los
especímenes colectados, se completo la descripción de Otatea ramirezii, describiendo las inflorescencias y flores. Esas
estructuras se compararon con la de las especies conocidas de Otatea descritas con flores. La colección nacional de
bambúes Mexicanos es muy importante para la conservación de las especies nativas y dado que los ciclos de floración de
la mayoría de las especies de bambúes no se conocen, la documentación de sus ciclos de vida es necesaria.

Introduction
In the Americas, the highest bamboo diversity and endemism is found in Brazil, the northern and central
Andes, Mexico and Central America (Judziewicz et al., 1999). Prior to 2004 there were 36 native species of
bamboos described in eight genera for Mexico (Judziewicz et al., 1999; Cortés Rodríguez 2000; Clark and
Cortés 2004), but recent work has brought this number to 44 species (Judziewicz et al., 1999; Ruiz-Sanchez et
al., 2011, 2011a; Ruiz-Sanchez 2012; Ruiz-Sanchez and Clark 2013) and three more are in the process of
being described. More than the half (23) of the Mexican bamboo species are endemic and this number could
increase with the description of new taxa. The Mexican bamboos grow in tropical dry and perennial forests,
mixed pine-oak and pine-spruce forests, pine forests, and cloud forests from sea level to 3,000 m elevation
(Cortés Rodríguez 2000; Ruiz-Sanchez et al., 2011, 2011a; Ruiz-Sanchez & Clark 2013).

The Francisco Javier Clavijero Botanical Garden at the Instituto de Ecología, A.C. (INECOL) in Xalapa,
Veracruz, Mexico houses the Mexican national living bamboo collection that was created in a collaborative
effort by INECOL, Bamboos of the Americas (BOTA), and the Instituto Tecnológico de Chetumal for the ex
situ preservation of Mexican bamboo diversity, and for the purposes of research and teaching the public about
Mexican bamboo species. The living Mexican bamboo collection has 31 of the 44 described species, some of
which have been difficult to cultivate due their requirement for special abiotic conditions (temperature,
humidity, soil type, etc.).
One of the eight genera of bamboos present in Mexico is Otatea (McClure & E.W. Sm) Calderón &
Soderstrom (1980: 21). With eight described species (Guzmán et al. 1984; Clark and Cortés 2004; RuizSanchez et al., 2011; Ruiz-Sanchez 2012), it is the second most speciose bamboo genus in Mexico, behind
Chusquea Kunth (1822: 151) with 18 described species (Cortés Rodríguez 2000; Ruiz-Sanchez & Clark
2013). Like most bamboos, Otatea is a semelparous genus with mass flowering in cycles that, according to
herbarium records, occur in 8-30 year cycles (Guzmán et al., 1984; Judziewicz et al., 1999; Ruiz-Sanchez et
al., 2011). Populations usually flower for two or three years consecutively and then die (Ruiz-Sanchez et al.,
2011). Some species of Otateaǡ such as O. fimbriata Soderstrom in McVaugh (1983: 280) have synchronous
flowering, while others, such as O. acuminata (Munro) Calderón & Soderstrom (1980: 21), O. glauca Clark &
G. Cortés (2004: 3) and O. ramirezii Ruiz-Sanchez (2012: 25), flower asynchronously (Ruiz-Sanchez et al.,
2011; personal observation).
During fieldwork in the Querétaro state in 2010, I collected a potentially new species of Otatea. This
specimen was described as Otatea ramirezii based on its vegetative morphology characters, without flowering
characters because the population was sterile. Other Otatea species (O. carrilloi Ruiz-Sanchez, Sosa & MejíaSaulés in Ruiz-Sanchez et al. (2011: 324) and O. transvolcanica Ruiz-Sanchez & L.G. Clark in Ruiz-Sanchez
et al. (2011: 330) have also been initially described based only on vegetative morphological characters (RuizSanchez et al., 2011). The O. ramirezii specimen was cultivated at the Francisco Javier Clavijero Botanical
Garden and deposited in the Mexican national living bamboo collection. Over the course of regular visits to
the collection I saw the specimen of O. ramirezii flowering, and decided to visit the population in Querétaro.
There, I found the entire population flowering synchronously and noted that some individuals had flowered
the previous year. I collected several flowering specimens and described and illustrated the flowers of O.
ramirezii (Fig. 1, 2) and constructed a flowering key to the species of Otatea with known flowers.

Comparison:—On the basis of vegetative morphology Otatea ramirezii is similar to O. acuminata, O.
carrilloi and O. glauca, but based on flowering characters O. ramirezii is more similar to O. acuminata and O.
fimbriata. Synflorescence size in O. fimbriata is 10–15 cm long with 30–33 spikelets, whereas in O.
acuminata the synflorescence size ranges between 6.5–10 cm long with 6–15 spikelets, while the
synflorescence length in O. ramirezii is 5–9.5 cm with 6–25 spikelets. The average lengths of glumes, lemmas
and paleas are very similar in O. acuminata and O. ramirezii; the differences are the following: O. acuminata
has the lemma and palea keels pubescent and the lodicules glabrous with ciliate margins, whereas O. ramirezii
has the lemma keels scabrous, the palea keels glabrous and pubescent lodicules.

Discussion
The purposes of botanical gardens include increasing public awareness and promoting research and the
conservation of plant diversity (Wyse Jackson 1999; Pautasso and Parmentier 2007). Today there are more
than 3,000 botanical gardens in 156 countries, with over 6 million accessions of living plants, and

approximately 80,000 taxa in cultivation (Pautasso and Parmentier 2007; Dosmann and Groover 2012). One
such garden is the Francisco Javier Clavijero Botanical Garden at the INECOL in Xalapa, Veracruz, Mexico,
which is home to two living national collections: the national cycad collection and the Mexican national living
bamboo collection. Living collections are curated for various purposes including scientific education and
research (Dosmann and Groover 2012). Living collections include germplasm repositories that preserve plant
genetic resources for research and conservation. There are also experimental research plots, seed banks,
conservatories, and germplasm repositories for research carried out by universities and research institutions
(Dosmann and Groover 2012).
Living collections are important for understanding how plants respond to global climate change because
they are particularly valuable sources of long-term data (Primack and Miller-Rushing 2009). Researchers at
botanical gardens can address the question of how long-lived individual plants respond to climate change and
other environmental stimuli over their lifetimes in terms of physiology, growth, anatomy and phenology
(Primack and Miller-Rushing 2009).
It is challenging to study phenology in woody bamboos because their flowering cycles last between 3 and
120 years (Janzen 1976). Several hypotheses have been invoked to explain this: the predator satiation
hypothesis (Janzen 1976); the resource allocation hypothesis (Gadgil and Bossert 1970; Schaffer 1974); the
habitat modification hypothesis (Stearns 1980); and the bamboo fire cycle (Keeley and Bond 1999). Franklin
(2004) described four spatio-temporal patterns of flowering, in addition to gregarious monocarpy, that have
been detected among semelparous bamboos:
1. A small percentage of clumps flower the year (or two) before and after the main flowering event, and
this is called “flowering distribution” by Janzen (1976);
2. Gregarious flowering occurs in patches in successive years, referred to as a “flowering wave” by Troup (1921);
3. Variation in periodicity between populations leads to diffuse temporality within a species;
4. “Sporadic flowering” may imply random or other non-gregarious patterns of flowering (Franklin 2004).
In Otatea acuminata the first and third patterns have been observed (Ruiz-Sanchez et al. 2011). For O.
fimbriata the second pattern has been observed in Chiapas (personal observation), and a specimen collected
there in 2005 was planted in the living national bamboo collection. In 2008 the cultivated plant flowered and
flowering was verified the same year in the field. For O. ramirezii, I observed a few clumps in the living
collection that had flowered in 2011, because we saw dead or dying clumps and a few new seedlings in the
soil, directly beneath the potential mother. Then, in the summer of 2012, I saw the entire wild population
flowering gregariously. These field observations agree with the pattern of Janzen’s (1976) “flowering
distribution”. For O. glauca we observed the fourth pattern of “sporadic flowering”. We collected only a
single plant with flowers in 2005 in Chiapas and the rest of the clumps were sterile. On subsequent visits to
the population we did not observe any other clump flowering.
Without the living national bamboo collection, it would have been difficult to observe the flowering of
Otatea ramirezii; the flowering of O. ramirezii in the living collection allowed us to confirm flowering in the
wild population. To date, there are still two Otatea species for which the flowers have not been described: O.
carrilloi and O. transvolcanica. The latter is under cultivation in the collection and hopefully will be observed
flowering in the years to come. We will then have the opportunity to confirm its flowering in the field.
Another advantage of having the living national bamboo collection is that over time, we can determine the
flowering cycles of O. ramirezii and other species living in the collection for which flowering cycle records
are not currently available.
