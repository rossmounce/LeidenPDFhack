Abstract
Recent phylogenetic analyses show that the species of the southern African genera Pauridia, Saniella and Spiloxene and
the Australian, Tasmanian and New Zealand Hypoxis sect. Ianthe form a highly supported, monophyletic clade. In
keeping with earlier suggestions that these taxa doubtfully warrant separate status, and to avoid the recognition of
Hypoxis and Spiloxene as paraphyletic, we expand the circumscription of Pauridia to include Saniella, Spiloxene and
Hypoxis sect. Ianthe. As a result 33 new combinations at specific and infraspecific level are proposed and one epitype,
two neotypes and 30 lectotypes are newly designated. Three basionyms, of which Linnaeus, Linnaeus filius and Lamarck
are the authors, are also typified (Amaryllis capensis, Hypoxis aquatica, and Hypoxis pumila).
Key words: Hypoxidaceae, Hypoxis, new combination, Pauridia, Saniella, Spiloxene, taxonomy, typification

Introduction
For many years the circumscription of the genera included in the Hypoxidaceae R.Br. has posed major
challenges to taxonomists studying the family (Nordal 1998, Burtt 2000). Past difficulties have been largely
resolved, however, by the recent phylogenetic study of Kocyan et al. (2011), particularly with regard to
understanding the relationships amongst the temperate southern hemisphere taxa, Pauridia Harvey (1838:
341), Saniella Hilliard & Burtt (1978: 70), Spiloxene Salisbury (1866: 44), and Hypoxis Linnaeus (1759: 986)
sect. Ianthe (Salisbury 1866: 44) Bentham & Hooker (1883: 717).
Based on sequence data from four plastid DNA regions, Kocyan et al. (2011) confirmed the paraphyly of
Spiloxene, as traditionally circumscribed by Nel (1914) and Garside (1936), and showed that Spiloxene is
monophyletic only with the inclusion of Pauridia, Saniella and the Australian, Tasmanian and New Zealand
species of Hypoxis belonging to sect. Ianthe, as given by Geerinck (1969) and Henderson (1987) (Fig. 1).
Synapomorphies supporting this cladistically robust monophyletic group, referred to as the Pauridia clade by
Kocyan et al. (2011), are the mucilage canals above the vascular bundles of the leaves (Rudall et al. 1998,
Thompson 1976) and disulcate, micro-echinate pollen grains, with the exception of the secondarily derived
trisulcate state in one of the Australian species (Simpson 1983, Rudall et al. 1998, Kocyan et al. unpubl. data).
According to Nel (1914: as Ianthe) and Garside (1936), Spiloxene is remarkably uniform, comprising
species that differ little from each other, often by a few, subtle features. According to the later, alternative
classification of Geerinck (1969), Spiloxene was placed under Hypoxis, within sect. Ianthe, adding to the
several species from Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand previously placed here. This change was not
favoured by South African botanists, who retained Nel’s classification for the African taxa (Garside 1950,

Thompson 1976, Thompson 1978, Manning et al. 2002), a decision which has been upheld since by the
molecular-based phylogenetic study of Kocyan et al. (2011). The Australian, Tasmanian and New Zealand
representatives of Hypoxis sect. Ianthe (Fig. 2E, F) are remarkably like the southern African species in
Spiloxene (Fig. 2A–D, G, H). All are cormous, characteristically glabrous herbs, apart from a few, short teeth
on the leaf margins in some species. The star-shaped flowers have six, rarely four, exposed stamens, a threelobed stigma, and tepals which are mostly free from each other and inserted directly above the ovary. An often
overlooked exception to this floral form is that of Spiloxene alba (Thunberg 1779: 26) Fourcade (1932: 76),
which has tepals inserted on an elongated ovary beak (Fig. 2B). Burtt’s (Burtt 2000) final treatment of
Saniella relied only on the presence of an ovary beak and a bowl-shaped perigone tube to distinguish Saniella
(Fig. 2J) from Spiloxene, so the continued separation of these genera remained doubtful.

FIGURE 1. Cladogram illustrating the phylogenetic relationships of the 19 Pauridia species treated by molecular systematic means
so far (redrawn after Kocyan et al. 2011). 1Formerly in Hypoxis sect. Ianthe; 2formerly in Spiloxene; 3formerly in Saniella. Maximum
likelihood heuristic bootstrap analysis = 100 for the clade.

Like Saniella, the flowers of Pauridia also have a cup-shaped perigone tube (Fig. 2I). Pauridia, however,
is unusual within Hypoxidaceae in having only three fertile stamens and three short, hooked processes on the
style, although the flowers do have the same vascular supply as normal six-stamened Hypoxidaceae flowers.
This apart, its other characters are common to both Spiloxene and Saniella. In contrast, plants of Hypoxis
sensu stricto differ from those in all the above taxa by having a vertical rhizome and a pubescent covering, at
least on the outside of the flowers.
When Spiloxene was last revised, the species were divided among seven unranked groups, based primarily
on small structural differences of the corm tunics (Nel 1914). None of these groups is supported in the study by
Kocyan et al. (2011) and any attempts to divide the Pauridia clade into monophyletic subgroups would have to
invoke various combinations of non-synapomorphic characters, making any formal reclassification unworkable.
Consequently, we favour the recognition of one expanded genus, based on the known synapomorphies of leaf
anatomy and pollen micromorphology. In so doing, we put into effect Burtt’s (Burtt 2000) earlier suggestion that
these taxa could warrant treatment as one genus. Since Pauridia has nomenclatural priority over Spiloxene and
Saniella, the amplification of the genus necessitates several new combinations. In effect 33 more taxa are added
to the two species, P. minuta (Linnaeus f. 1782: 92) Durand & Schinz (1894: 142) and P. longituba Thompson
(1972: 163), already recognized within Pauridia by Thompson (1979).

THE GENUS PAURIDIA (HYPOXIDACEAE)

Phytotaxa 116 (1) © 2013 Magnolia Press

• 21

The name Pauridia, dating from 1838, has been consistently applied in all floristic treatments from that of
Baker (1896) to the present day (Manning & Goldblatt 2012). The name Spiloxene only came into usage in
1932 (Fourcade 1932), having formerly been known by the illegitimate name Ianthe Nel (1914). Since then it
has slowly gained acceptance in the floristic literature of southern Africa, but has always been given together
with the closely allied genus Pauridia. This change in usage was applied only to the southern African taxa.
After 1932, reference to Ianthe, rather than Spiloxene, can still be traced to Markötter (1936) and de Vos
(1948). In Melchior (1964) and Hutchinson (1959) Ianthe was treated as a synonym of Hypoxis, whereas
Geerinck (1969) and Henderson (1987) retained the name Ianthe as Hypoxis section Ianthe.
With the publication in recent years of several popular books on Cape plants, the name Spiloxene has
gained modest usage amongst specialist bulb growers, mainly through Spiloxene capensis (Linnaeus 1760:
10) Garside (1936: 74) which has large, star-shaped flowers, often with brilliant peacock-coloured centres.
The name Pauridia, in contrast, has been consistently used in literature for a much longer period than
Spiloxene and although none of the species is in cultivation it is known to a growing number of nontaxonomists through images of the species in popular books (Manning et al. 2002), articles (Thompson 1980,
Snijman 2008) and websites for citizen science [www.ispot.org.za/species_dictionary/Pauridia].
Since the nomenclatural changes proposed here are as a result of a changed taxonomic concept and since
the possible advantages of proposing to use the name Spiloxene, which has never been consistently applied,
do not outweigh the use of the taxonomically well-established name Pauridia, we resort to the rule of
nomenclatural priority as given in the ICN (McNeill et al. 2012).
We make new combinations for all the Australian, Tasmanian and New Zealand taxa currently recognized
within Hypoxis sect. Ianthe, but in other respects follow the previous taxonomic conclusions for the Flora of
Australia (Henderson 1987). Since the typification of many of the southern African species has remained
unresolved to date, we designate, where necessary, types for all the currently recognized taxa as given by
Govaerts (2012) and discuss the particular problems associated with the names attributed to Linnaeus,
Linnaeus filius and Lamarck. New names have been assigned to two species and the rank of one infraspecific
taxon has been raised from variety to subspecies. Invalid names excluded from Pauridia sensu lato have been
discussed by Nordenstam (1972: as Spiloxene).

Materials and methods
The names in bold, arranged alphabetically, are those in current use at the rank accepted by us. We cite or
designate types for the accepted name of each taxon, but those for all the known corresponding synonyms, as
given by Govaerts (2012), will be designated in a revision of Pauridia currently in preparation. A holotype, as
interpreted below, is the single numbered specimen, as designated by the original author, who also stipulated
the herbarium in which it is lodged. We have chosen lectotypes, epitypes and neotypes according to the
relevant articles of the ICN (McNeill et al. 2012) and have examined all the relevant taxonomic literature.
Herbarium material for the group has been studied in South Africa’s major herbaria (BOL, GRA, NBG, NH,
PRE, SAM) and on JSTOR Plant Science [http://plants.jstor.org/] for European herbaria. Images of important
specimens were also obtained from B, G, K, LINN, M, P, PR and UPS (codes according to Thiers 2012).

correctly argued against the generic name Ianthe, which is a later homonym and orthographical variant of
Janthe Griseb. (McNeil et al. 2012: Art. 53.1), in favour of Spiloxene.

Note:—Until now Hypoxis affinis has been treated as a synonym of Spiloxene alba, possibly explaining why
the name was overlooked by Bolus (1893), who later described matching plants as H. schlechteri. Like H.
affinis, the early collections of H. schlechteri have also often been misidentified as S. alba, likely due to the
apparent similarities in their succulent, terete leaves, which are often immature at the outset of flowering, and
the flowers which are pink or reddish below. The southwestern Cape S. schlechteri has small, blackish brown
corms covered by hard, fibrous ribs, which are simple and pectinate below and reticulate above, and the
flowers, although yellow when fresh, characteristically dry reddish brown on the back, often fading to white
ventrally, all features mentioned in the protologue of H. affinis. In contrast, S. alba has large, mostly naked
corms with fine, brown fibres confined to a loose tuft above.

Thunberg s.n. (UPS-THUNB! No. 8248 [image]). Included amongst Thunberg’s collections in UPS are three sheets
annotated as ‘Hypoxis alba’. Sheet 8248 is the one that most clearly shows the diagnostic, oblong ovary (fruit)
mentioned in the protologue.
= Hypoxis pumila Lamarck (1789: 184), syn. nov. Type (lectotype designated here):—SOUTH AFRICA. Cap de Bonneespérance, Lamarck s.n. (P! No. P00562768 [image], solitary-flowered specimen on right hand side of sheet). To
date Hypoxis pumila has been treated as a synonym of Spiloxene minuta (L.) Fourcade (1932: 76), most recently by
Govaerts (2012: record number 279164). The protologue of H. pumila states: “scapis foliosis unifloris” which is at
variance with that of Helonias minuta Linnaeus (1771: 225), the basionym of S. minuta, which has “scapis ramosis”.
Lamarck’s collection (P) includes one sheet that bears the name Hypoxis pumila. The plant on the left hand side of
the sheet bears two inflorescences and the scape in each bears two flowers. This is taken to match Linnaeus’
description of “scapis ramosis” for S. minuta, on the assumption that the “divided scape” refers to the scape
‘dividing’ apically into a two-flowered inflorescence. The plant on the right hand side of the sheet, in contrast, bears
a single-flowered inflorescence which is in accordance with Lamarck’s description, hence its choice as lectotype of
H. pumila. It matches some of the smallest representatives of Pauridia alba.

Note:—According to Bullock (1962), Fabricia Thunberg (1779: 23) is a synonym of the legitimately named
Empodium Salisbury (1866: 43). Plants belonging to Fabricia alba, the basionym of Pauridia alba, have none
of the diagnostic features of Empodium, namely a unilocular ovary with three parietal placentas and an
inflorescence which consists of a single flower without bracts.

(McNeil et al. 2012: Art. 7.4). In B only one sheet collected by Meyer has been annotated by Nel as ‘Forbesia
occidentalis’. Nel’s protologue; fails to indicate the number of the exsiccatum in B, thus this sheet is designated a
lectotype.

≡

Note:—Bullock (1962) correctly treated Forbesia Ecklon ex Nel (1914: 243), a later homonym for Forbesia
Johnson (1912: 177), as a synonym of Empodium Salisb. Due to several important morphological differences
from the other species of Forbesia, namely white (not yellow) flowers and V-shaped (not plicate) leaves,
Forbesia occidentalis was subsequently transferred into Saniella (Burtt 2000). Since the epithet ‘occidentalis’
is taken up in the Australian species with the basionym Hypoxis occidentalis Bentham (1873: 451), we assign
a new name to this previously much misunderstood species from Northern Cape, South Africa.

Typification:—Because the lectotype of Hypoxis aquatica is inadequate for critical study we designate an
epitype to support the lectotypification (McNeil et al. 2012: Art. 9.8). H. Bolus 2814 shows the characteristic
inflorescence and slender leaves, as recognized in recent accounts of the species (Garside 1950, Manning et
al. 2002).
Note:—Pauridia aquatica, well known as Spiloxene aquatica, is widespread in the Greater Cape Floristic
Region, South Africa. The protologue of Hypoxis aquatica indicates that the younger Linnaeus (1782) was
unable to find the type specimen of this species in his father’s herbarium: “Hanc ego non vidi, mirror itaque
unde descriptio facta fuit, cum nondum in Herbario eam reperire potui.” A study of manuscript material in
possession of the Linnean Society, London (Barnard 1970), has revealed that the type specimen of Hypoxis
aquatica is Sparrman 124 (LINN 1238.3), filed under Chrysitrix. The original details of Sparrman’s collection
‘Sp. 124’ appear in the list compiled by Linnaeus which is referred to by Savage (1945) as the ‘Sparrmanni
Capenses Ms. list ca. 1772’. Sparrman’s number 124 appears in the third part of this list against the words
‘Dioecia hexandria’, the Class to which the plant might belong, following Sparrman’s opinion that the plants’
solitary flowers are hermaphrodite but the umbellate flowers (on the right hand side of the sheet and now
missing) were male. Thus in this list, Linnaeus placed No. 124 between Viscum Linnaeus (1753: 1023)
(Dioecia tetrandria) and Arctopus Linnaeus (1753: 1058) (Polygamia dioecia). He also gave the plant a new
name, Hydrophylax (Linnaeus f. 1782: 126), for which the flowers are described as ‘in aliis solitarii
hermaphroditi in aliis umbellate mares’. The original generic and specific descriptions are given on two slips
in the Slip Index in the Linnean Society’s Library. These descriptions were later transcribed into the
Amannensis Draft for Mantissa 3: the generic description of Hydrophylax on page 16 and the species
description, still without a specific name, on page 124. Only later did Linnaeus add, in his own hand, the
specific epithet ‘natans’. Among the many alterations that Linnaeus subsequently made to the Draft, two relate
to Hydrophylax. The two entries for Hydrophylax and natans were crossed out and inserted on the interleaf
opposite Hypoxis (page 49). Here Linnaeus has rewritten the description of Hydrophylax natans under the
name Hypoxis aquatica, but in so doing he omitted the reference to Sparrman as the collector. Having used the
Amannensis Draft of Mantissa 3 as the basis of his own work, this is the entry that the younger Linnaeus would
have found and published in the Supplementum (Linnaeus f. 1782) as Hypoxis aquatica.
James Edward Smith, who was in possession of Linnaeus’s collections for several years, may have been
responsible for having placed the type sheet, which is devoid of a name, under Chrysitrix. His handwriting on
a note attached to the specimen suggests that he found it incorrectly placed, having been ‘found in Restio’. It
is likely that he then checked Sparrman’s number with the Sparrmanni Capenses list. Finding it cited next to
Arctopus (Polygamia dioecia), it is probable that he assigned the sheet to Chrysitrix, the only genus in that
class to which it could possibly belong.
Since no flowers remain in the four-pedicellate umbel of the plant on the right hand side of the sheet, it
can never be known why Sparrman and Linnaeus thought these flowers were male. Field studies have shown,
however, that the flowers of this and other species of Pauridia are frequently visited by beetles which feed on
the floral parts (Kocyan et al. 2011: as Spiloxene). Hence it is probable that Sparrman’s ‘male flowers’ in
Pauridia aquatica were beetle-induced.
The fruiting plant on the left hand side of the sheet of Sparrman’s collection is typical of Spiloxene
capensis (Linnaeus 1760: 10) Garside (1936: 74) or Spiloxene canaliculata Garside (1942: 249) in having a
long, solitary sheathing bract inserted at the articulation between the scape and pedicel. The identity of the
detached flower mounted on the top left hand corner of the sheet, however, remains uncertain.

Pauridia canaliculata (Garside) Snijman & Kocyan, comb. nov.
Bas.:—Spiloxene canaliculata Garside (1942: 249). Type (holotype):—SOUTH AFRICA. [Western Cape], roadside near
stream between Darling and Yzerfontein, 18 September 1932, Garside 4211 (BOL!)

Pauridia capensis (L.) Snijman & Kocyan, comb. nov.
Spiloxene capensis (L.) Garside (1936: 74)
Bas.:—Amaryllis capensis Linnaeus (1760: 10), non Miller (1768: 12). Type (neotype designated here):—SOUTH
AFRICA. [Cape], Caput bonae spei, Oldenland s.n. (G! in Collection Burman [image], named Sisyrinchium
aethiopicum foliis gramineis [?] nivei anthos Sisyrinchium Cornuti Hist Canad. 168)
Concerted efforts to trace any original material annotated in Linnaeus’ hand of Amaryllis capensis, the basionym of
Pauridia capensis, have proved to be problematic (Jarvis 2007). The only reference to original material in Linnaeus’
(1760) protologue is to Sisyrrhinchium (sic) in Cornut (1635), but with no reference to a page or figure number.
Cornut’s work includes an illustration (Cornut 1635: 165 t. Xiij) of Sisynrichium indicum (sic), which is later
explicitly referred to by Linnaeus (1762) as a synonym of Amaryllis capensis. The figure depicts a plant in which the
flowers have five tepals, none with a dark base, a solitary, capitate stigma and a scape which lacks a persistent
spathe. None of these features match the protologue: ‘Scapus infra medium vaginatus. Petala lanceolata, basi
interiore atra. Stigmata tria’, and consequently, it cannot be eligible as the lectotype of Amaryllis capensis. The
reference to Cornut’s publication does, however, provide a link to a sheet in Burman’s herbarium (G), the source for
Linnaeus’ Plantae Rariores Africanae (Jarvis 2007), which was based largely on the plants collected by Oldenland
circa 1695. This sheet has two plants mounted on paper cut from some other source and it is annotated in writing that
matches Oldenland’s hand, with the phrase name Sisyrinchium aethiopicum foliis gramineis [?] nivei anthos, with
reference to Sisyrinchium Cornuti Hist Canad. 168. We presume that the page number 168 is a typographic error for
165, since the description on page 168 of this work is of a plant referred to as Solidago maxima. The dried plants are
numbered two and three respectively above each corm and they appear to be part of a set comprising at least an
additional specimen, numbered four in the same hand, mounted on paper characterized by an irregularly cut top right
edge and annotated ‘Amaryllis capensis’, thought to be in the hand of Burman. The unevenly cut corner suggests
that this sheet is also one of Oldenland’s collections (see Jarvis 2007: 224), probably removed from an original
volume believed to have held his Cape collections (Nordenstam 1968: 92). Although the plants on both sheets of this
set correspond well with Linnaeus’ protologue of Amaryllis capensis, the sheet referring to Cornut’s publication in
Oldenland’s hand shows the characteristics most clearly. The scape is sheathed below the middle by a persistent
spathe and although the stigma is concealed in the left hand specimen, it is exposed and clearly 3-branched in the
adjacent plant. The dark spots at the base of the tepals, which were explicitly described by Linnaeus (1760), can be
seen clearly in the left hand plant. To maintain what has become established usage of the epithet in Spiloxene from
1936 onwards (Garside 1936, Arnold & De Wet 1993, Goldblatt & Manning 2000, Manning et al. 2002,
Germishuizen & Meyer 2003, Klopper et al. 2006), we designate a neotype of Amaryllis capensis, namely
Oldenland s.n. (G!, the sheet with the phrase name, Sisyrinchium aethiopicum foliis gramineis [?] nivei anthos
Sisyrinchium Cornuti Hist Canad. 168) in Burman’s herbarium.

Typification:—Bolus (1893) specifies only one collection in his protologue: R. Schlechter (No. 627). Since
none of the exsiccata bears Bolus’ handwriting, we designate the specimen in K as lectotype since it best
matches the description and illustration in the protologue.

Bas.:—Hypoxis gracilipes Schlechter (1900: 88) Ianthe gracilipes (Schltr.) Williams (1901: 292). Type (lectotype
designated here):—SOUTH AFRICA. [Western Cape], Piqueniers Kloof, 2000 ft [610 m], 29 June 1896, R.
Schlechter 7957 (BOL!, isolectotypes E, K! No. K000255996 [image], COI! [image], GRA!, LISC! [image], PRE!,
S! [image]). R. Schlechter 7957, the only collection given in the protologue, is not associated with any particular
herbarium. As lectotype we designate the numbered specimen in K since it shows the characteristic inflorescence
described in the protologue, namely the slender scape that is devoid of all but the most minute bract.
= Ianthe cuspidata Nel (1914: 294) Spiloxene cuspidata (Nel) Garside (1936: 268) Hypoxis cuspidata (Nel) Geerinck

19] (B! No. 100089225 [image], isotype W). Nel’s protologue mentions a single pair of numbered specimens, one in
B and the other in W (Nel 1914). The holotype, which is annotated by Nel as the “original”, is in B.

≡

Note:—Spiloxene gracilipes was informally treated as part of the S. ovata (Linnaeus f. 1782: 197) Garside
(1936: 268) complex in Goldblatt & Manning (2000: 110). Further studies have resolved several differences
between the two species (D. Snijman in prep.). The yellow-flowered Pauridia gracilipes is widespread in the
western part of the Greater Cape Floristic Region, unlike P. ovata (L.f.) Snijman & Kocyan, which has white
flowers and is restricted to the Overberg in the southern part of the Cape Region.
Plants of Pauridia gracilipes vary considerably in size and the most diminutive forms of the species,
found in the Olifants River Valley, Western Cape, resemble the type of S. cuspidata. As did Hilliard & Burtt
(1978), we disagree with some of the statements made by Nel (1914), who regarded S. cuspidata as having
two filiform bracts on the scape, whereas only one is evident on the type specimen.

Typification:—The colour plate, painted from a plant grown in Hibbert’s living collection at Clapham, is
designated as the lectotype since it clearly shows the flower’s colour, an important character given in the
protologue. A dried voucher specimen of this plant is not known.
Note:—Although Spiloxene linearis was regarded as part of the S. serrata (Thunberg 1779: 29) Garside
(1936: 268) complex in Goldblatt & Manning (2000: 110), the name has never been formally placed into
synonymy with S. serrata. Currently it is recognized as a highly localized, Vulnerable species in the Red List
of South African plants (Raimondo et al. 2009: 125).

Typification:—Schlechter (1900) mentions only one of his numbered collections in the protologue, without
any reference to where it was seen. The specimen in BOL is of two whole plants which show clearly the
submembranous bracts described in the protologue.
Note:—Spiloxene maximiliani was incorrectly listed as a synonym of S. umbraticola (Schlechter 1900:
89) Garside (1936: 269) in Germishuizen & Meyer (2003) and Klopper et al. (2006). Although superficially
resembling each other in leaf, S. maximiliani is distinguished by a unilocular ovary, unlike the fully threelocular S. umbraticola.

≡

≡

≡

≡

Typification:—In the protologue of Helonias minuta, Linnaeus (1771) referred to a collection by Koenig
[König], but no original material has been traced (Jarvis 2007). The neotype designated here, (LINN No.
427.12), which bears the name Hypoxis minuta in Linnaeus filius’ hand, clearly matches Linnaeus’ (1771)
protologue of Helonias minuta. The plant on sheet 427.12 has been mounted with the base of the corm facing
upwards to reveal its truncate base and distinct, broad basal rim, above which the fibrous tunics converge
towards the narrow neck. This distinctively shaped corm, which matches the description in the protologue, is
unique to the species. Given that the epithet is occupied in Pauridia minuta Durand & Schinz (1894: 142), the
species is newly named Pauridia pygmaea.
Note:—We agree with Thompson (1979) that Fabricia minuta does not constitute a synonym of Pauridia
minuta, as given by Geerinck (1969), since the plant under this name has six stamens, unlike the threestamened P. minuta. Hence the name F. minuta is treated here as a synonym of Pauridia pygmaea. Fabricia
minuta was incorrectly assigned to the genus Fabricia Thunb. which, following the typification of the genus
by Bullock (1962), is a synonym of Empodium Salisb. Linnaeus (1771) incorrectly included Helonias minuta
in his genus Helonias (1753: 342), the type of which is Helonias bullata Linnaeus (1753: 342) that falls within
the family Melanthiaceae Batsch.

Note:—Spiloxene serrata exhibits a wide range of variation over its geographic distribution, especially with
regard to corm covering and leaf width. Nel (1914) originally described Ianthe dielsiana, as differing from S.
serrata by the root-entangled corms and the narrower, apparently terete leaves. These characteristics recur in
randomly scattered populations throughout the widespread geographic range of S. serrata, hence both S.
dielsiana and the recently described S. namaquana are treated here as conspecific with S. serrata, now known
as Pauridia serrata. Fabricia serrata was incorrectly assigned to the genus Fabricia Thunb. which, based on
the typification of the genus by Bullock (1962), is a synonym of Empodium Salisb.

isolectotypes BOL!, K! No. K000255997 [image], PRE!, S! [image], WAG! [image], ZT!). Two collections are
mentioned in the protologue. Of these, Schlechter 10945 is the most well represented in herbaria. The specimen in
K, which is inscribed as Ianthe serrata var. albiflora by Nel, is designated as lectotype.
= Hypoxis alba var. gracilis Baker (1878: 102), syn. nov. Type (lectotype designated here):—(illustration in) Loddiges
(1825: t. 1074). Apart from the illustration in Loddiges (1825), none of the other original material given in the
protologue indicates that the flowers of this taxon are white. Since the presence of white flowers is diagnostic,
Loddiges’ illustration is designated as the lectotype.

≡

Note:—Baker (1878) described Hypoxis alba var. gracilis as having solitary flowers which, from his
reference to Loddiges (1825: t. 1074), he infers as having white tepals. Only rarely does Pauridia alba have
solitary flowers and if so, the inflorescence is longer than the leaves. In contrast, Loddiges’ illustration of
Hypoxis alba var. gracilis shows the inflorescence as long as the leaves, a characteristic feature of P. serrata
subsp. albiflora. The two taxa also differ in the size and shape of the inflorescence bracts. These are
conspicuously large on P. alba and inconspicuous in P. serrata subsp. albiflora, as suggested in the
illustration.
The white-flowered populations of S. serrata, previously treated as var. albiflora are recognized here as P.
serrata subsp. albiflora, being morphologically and ecologically distinct from the yellow-flowered and
widespread populations constituting subsp. serrata.

of Eastern Moorabooi River crossing on Ballan–Mt Egerton road, 25 October 1978, T.B. Muir 6246 (MEL)

Pauridia verna (Hilliard & B.L.Burtt) Snijman & Kocyan, comb. nov.
Bas.:—Saniella verna Hilliard & Burtt (1978: 71). Type (holotype):—LESOTHO. Black Mountains, between Sani and
Mokhotlong, ca. 3050 m, 5 November 1973, Hilliard & Burtt 7076 (E! [image], isotype NU)

Uncertain species
Hypoxis andrewsii Baker (1878: 104). Type (lectotype designated here):—(illustration in) Andrews (1801: t.
195)
Note:—Baker (1878) cited Hypoxis obliqua Andrews (1801: t. 195) [nom. illeg., non Hypoxis obliqua Jacquin
(1797: 54) (McNeil et al. 2012: Art. 53.1)] in his protologue of Hypoxis andrewsii. Baker noted, however, that
there was conflict between Andrews’ iconography and Andrews’ diagnosis of H. obliqua (the stem is hairy in
the diagnosis but it is glabrous in the illustration), thus he gave it a new name and placed it within Hypoxis
subgenus Ianthe, which only includes plants that are entirely glabrous. Baker’s protologue also cites a plant
referred to as “C. B. Spei, Hort. Hibberd [Hibbert], anno 1801” which he never saw. In the absence of a
preserved specimen and because the identity of the plant in Andrews’ illustration remains doubtful, Hypoxis
andrewsii is treated here as an uncertain species.
