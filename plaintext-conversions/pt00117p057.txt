Abstract
Euphorbia otjipembana was hitherto only known from the type locality within the Kaokoveld Centre of Endemism,
northwestern Namibia. Subsequently several additional populations were discovered, allowing for an amplified
description of the species and the recognition of two subspecies. Euphorbia otjipembana subsp. okakoraensis, here
described as a new subspecies, is only known from a small area within the Kaokoveld Centre. Diagnostic characters for
subsp. okakoraensis include a shrubby habit and medium (up to 1 m) height, 5–7-angled, scarcely constricted branches
with two pairs of spines per node and single cymes comprising of three horizontally arranged cyathia. A key as well as a
comparative table with diagnostic morphological characters to distinguish between the two subspecies of E. otjipembana
is provided.

Introduction
At present three described species of medium-sized (up to 1 m tall), shrubby succulent Euphorbia Linnaeus
(1753: 450), belonging to subgenus Euphorbia section Euphorbia, are known from the Namibian part of the
Kaokoveld (Leach 1976, Bruyns 2006). Euphorbia kaokoensis (White, Dyer & Sloane 1941: 965) Leach
(1976: 33) occurs from the eastern Kaokoveld (Kamanjab area) to the northern and northwestern parts
(Etengwa and Onjuva respectively). Euphorbia subsalsa subsp. fluvialis Leach (1976: 29) is widespread in
the Kunene River Valley, from the Ruacana Falls to Epupa. Euphorbia otjipembana Leach (1976: 29) was
hitherto only known from the type locality near Otjipemba in the northern Kaokoveld (Leach 1976, Craven
1999, Germishuizen & Meyer 2003). In this contribution a new subspecies of E. otjipembana is described and
an amplified description of the species is provided.
During a botanical expedition to the Otjihipa Mountains in the far northwestern corner of Namibia in
April 2006, the author encountered an unusual, succulent Euphorbia at the foot of the Okakora Mountains, 9
km to the northwest of Otjipemba, the type locality of E. otjipembana. During subsequent expeditions to the
same general area, additional populations of E. otjipembana were found in the Otjihipa and Omavanda
Mountains, which are situated to the west and east of Otjipemba respectively. While the Otjihipa and
Omavanda plants could at once be recognized as belonging to E. otjipembana, this was not the case with the
Okakora plants which had, inter alia, taller branches with a different colour. Close examination, however,
revealed many similarities with E. otjipembana. The Okakora plants are here proposed as representing a
distinct new subspecies of E. otjipembana. A study of the Euphorbia holdings in PRE and WIND revealed
only one other collection of the new subspecies (Leistner, Oliver, Steenkamp & Vorster 155) in PRE, filed
under E. otjipembana.
Live material of the new species was studied in the field. Morphological characters in the following
descriptions were all determined from live specimens and from fresh flowering material and ripe fruit.

Phenology:—Cyathia were recorded on subsp. okakoraensis from August to October.
Distribution and habitat:—At present Euphorbia otjipembana subsp. okakoraensis is known only from
the type locality, in the northern part of the Kaokoveld, northwestern Namibia (Fig. 3). This locally falls
within the Kaokoveld Centre of Endemism, a biogeographical region extending from northwestern Namibia
to southwestern Angola (Van Wyk & Smith 2001). It occurs 112 km from the coast, near Okombambi, in a
narrow gorge between the Baynes Mountains to the east and the Okakora Mountains to the west at an
elevation of 930 m. Average annual rainfall in the area is ± 200 mm (Mendelsohn et al. 2002). The subspecies

is locally uncommon and grows in rock crevices on the northeast-facing aspect of the Okakora Mountains in
full sun and in partially shaded areas. The substrate is stony soil derived from greywacke of the Mulden Group
of the Damara Sequence (Schreiber et al. 2002).
Conservation status:—Although rare and known from a single locality only, subsp. okakoaraensis is
probably not threatened as it occurs in a remote, almost inaccessible area. The local Ovahimba do not
distinguish among E. otjipembana subsp. okakoraensis, E. otjipembana subsp. otjipembana, E. kaokoensis and
E. subsalsa subsp. fluvialis and use the vernacular Otjiherero name ‘ohahi’ for all four taxa. The subspecies
okakoraensis is thus regarded as being poisonous and probably without any use, other than for poison. No signs
of damage caused by animals or humans could be found on any of the in-situ specimens examined.

Etymology:—The specific epithet refers to the Okakora Mountains, the Ovahimba name for the
mountains where the new subspecies is found.
Additional specimen examined (paratype):—NAMIBIA. Kunene Region: Kaokoveld, Otjomborombonga,
main kloof to the south, 1712BB, 14 July 1976, Leistner, Oliver, Steenkamp & Vorster 155 (PRE!).
Discussion:—The subspecies okakoraensis differs from the typical subspecies in the branches and in
some of the floral characters. In subsp. okakoraensis the stem epidermis is grey-green whereas in subsp.
otjipembana the epidermis is usually fresh (bright) green, rarely grey-green. Spine shields in subsp.
okakoraensis usually are much narrower at the apex (2–3 mm wide) and—while separate—longer (7–15 mm),
usually ± rectangular between the upper and lower spine pairs and ± parallel-sided or narrowly cuneate
towards the base, appearing drawn out. In the typical subspecies the spine shields are 2.8–5.2 mm wide, 5– 9
mm long and usually narrowly cuneate from apex to base.

FIGURE 3. Known distribution of E. otjipembana: subsp. otjipembana (open circle), both subspp. okakoraensis and otjipembana
(black dot).

Differences in the floral characters include the inflorescences, which in subsp. okakoraensis are shaded in
red, yellow and green and the cyathia which occasionally have six glands and six lobes instead of the usual
five. In subsp. otjipembana the inflorescences are yellow and the cyathia always have five glands and five
lobes. In subsp. okakoraensis the bracts on the peduncle and cyme branches lack thickening towards the base
and do not leave prominent scars as in the typical subspecies. The glands in subsp. okakoraensis are always
erect and not particularly fleshy, whereas in subsp. otjipembana they are sub-erect or spreading and fleshy.
Male flowers in subsp. okakoraensis are arranged in 5 or 6 fascicles whereas in subsp. otjipembana the
flowers are arranged in 5 fascicles only. Female flowers in subsp. okakoraensis have the ovary 3- or 4-lobed
and the pedicel is triangular, quadrate or pentagonal and the three or four ascending-spreading styles are
united in a slightly shorter column than in subsp. otjipembana. In the latter, the ovary is always 3-lobed, the
pedicel is pentagonal and the three styles are spreading-recurved. The capsule in subsp. okakoraensis is 3- or
4-locular whereas it is always 3-locular in subsp. otjipembana.

Apart from the morphological differences, the two subspecies have different flowering times. Subspecies
okakoraensis flowers from August to October and subsp. otjipembana from June to August. The different
flowering times were maintained even in cultivation in Windhoek, Namibia, where the two subspecies were
grown in close proximity during the study. Prominent morphological features to differentiate among subsp.
okakoaraensis and the typical subspecies are supplied in Table 1.

Euphorbia otjipembana subsp. okakoraensis can also be confused with E. kaokoensis and E. subsalsa
subsp. fluvialis, which too occur in the mountainous area along the Kunene River in northwestern Namibia.
These species share the shrubby habit, the grey-green colour of the branch epidermis and the spine shields
with two pairs of spines with subspecies okakoraensis. The latter, however, can be readily distinguished from
E. subsalsa subsp. fluvialis by its branches 18–35 mm in diam., which are 5–7-angled (3–5-angled on
branchlets), compressed or wing-like. In E. subsalsa subsp. fluvialis the branches are thinner (10–25 mm) and
consistently 4-angled with the angles compressed. The branches in E. kaokoensis are ± 20 mm in diam. and 5–
7-ribbed. The spine shields in E. kaokoensis furthermore differ from the other species in that the four spines
are more closely set thus appearing to arise almost from a common point.
