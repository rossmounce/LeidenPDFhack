Abstract
Baccharis magnifica, a new species endemic to the summits of the Serra do Caparaó along the border between Espírito
Santo and Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, is described. The new species is easily recognized by its shrubby habit,
showy green and slightly wine-tinged, long-petiolate leaves with ciliate margins and corymbiform capitulescences. It is
morphologically most similar to the allopatric B. macrophylla, which inhabits the mountain summits of the southerly
Serra da Mantiqueira range. Illustrations, a distribution map, habitat information, and a conservation assessment are also
provided for the new species.

Resumo
Baccharis magnifica, uma nova espécie endêmica dos picos da Serra do Caparaó, ao longo da divisa dos estados do
Espírito Santo e Minas Gerais, Sudeste do Brasil, é descrita. A nova espécie é facilmente reconhecível pelo hábito
arbustivo, folhagem vistosa verde e levemente vinácea, folhas com pecíolos longos e margens ciliadas e capitulescências
corimbiformes. Morfologicamente, assemelha-se à espécie alopátrica B. macrophylla, que habita os cumes das
montanhas da Serra da Mantiqueira meridional. Ilustrações, mapa de distribuição, informações sobre o habitat e estado
de conservação são fornecidos para a nova espécie.
Key words: Atlantic rain forest, Compositae, high altitude tropical grasslands

Introduction
Baccharis Linnaeus (1753: 860; Asteraceae: Astereae) comprises between 354 (Müller 2013) and 400 New World
species (Bremer 1994) and is broadly characterized by the usually tufted indumentum of the leaves and shoots and
the common occurrence of dioecy (Müller 2006). Currently, 175 species of Baccharis are recorded for Brazil, with
27 species found in Espírito Santo and 95 species in Minas Gerais states (Heiden & Schneider 2013).
Ongoing taxonomic studies of Baccharis, with extensive study of herbaria specimens and fieldwork across the
main centers of species diversity for the genus in Brazil, have allowed the recognition of a remarkable undescribed
species of Baccharis from the summits of Serra do Caparaó. The Serra do Caparaó mountain range is the highest
and northernmost of the tropical high altitude grasslands area (campos de altitude) in Brazil (Safford 1999a,
1999b). It is located in the Parque Nacional do Caparaó, which encompasses the highest mountain of eastern South
America (Pico da Bandeira) and its surroundings. The new species found in this area is described below, is
illustrated and its affinities, systematic position and geographic distribution are discussed.

Shrubs 1.3–1.8 m tall, erect; shoots terminating in a capitulescence, concomitantly originating dichotomous

wine, pinnate, brochidodromous, with 8–16 pairs of major lateral veins, midrib flat or slightly sunken on adaxial

Female capitulescence a corymbiform panicle of 5–7 racemes each bearing 5–21 capitula, terminal, 5–6 cm long,
4.4–8.3 cm diam. Capitula pedunculate; peduncles 4–8.5 mm long. Female capitula 3.7–4.3 mm long; florets 18–
26; involucre 3.5–4.1 mm long, 2.5–5.5 mm wide, cylindrical to campanulate; clinanthium (receptacle) convex,
paleate, glabrous, paleae linear-lanceolate; phyllaries 3–4-seriate, light brown, outer linear-ovate, median and
innermost lanceolate to linear-lanceolate, margins scarious, apex acute. Corollas 1.3–1.6 mm long, short-rayed,
sometimes with 2–3 apical teeth; style 1.6–1.8 mm long, branches 0.15–0.3 mm long. Cypselae 0.9–1.3 mm long,
0.3–0.5 mm wide, light brown, glabrous, narrowly obconical, laterally compressed, carpopodium annular, small,

Distribution:—Only known from localities at elevations between 2,350–2,834 m a.s.l. along the córrego José
Pedro and on the summits of the Pico da Bandeira and Pico do Cristal alongside the Serra do Caparaó range. The
creek and the peaks are the natural boundary between the states of Espírito Santo and Minas Gerais, southeastern
Brazil (Figure 3).

Habitat:—Baccharis magnifica forms sparse populations, along the escarpments (Figure 2) of the highest
summits of the Serra do Caparaó, on bare rock outcrops or in riverine vegetation within the sky islands
environments of the high altitude tropical grassland biome (Figure 4). This biome has a wider distribution,
presenting an archipelago-like pattern across the Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira ranges of mountains,
within the Atlantic Rainforest Domain (Safford 1999a, b).
Phenology:—Flowering specimens have been collected in February, while inflorescences with mature cypselae
can be found up to September.
Conservation status:—Because of the limited area of occupancy, the uniqueness of Caparaó habitat (a range of
mountains up to 2,892 m surrounded by medium-elevation hills and lowlands), the very low population size with
records of distribution from only three locations that are close to each other, and the decline of quality of the high
altitude grasslands environment due to anthropogenic pressure as accidental fires and tourism on the summits take
place, the new species is assessed as Endangered: EN B1ab(iii) (IUCN 2011).

Etymology:—The specific epithet refers to the size of the leaves and to the striking and overall aspect of the
plant.

Additional specimens examined (paratypes):—BRAZIL. Espírito Santo, Ibitirama, Parque Nacional do
Caparaó, Pico da Bandeira, escarpas, S 20º26'4", W 41º47'49", 2834 m, 1 October 2012, st., G. Heiden, C.T.
Oliveira, M. Bünger & V.L. Rezende 1955 (BHCB, RB, SPF). Minas Gerais: Alto Caparaó, Parque Nacional do
Caparaó, Pico do Cristal, [20º26'37"S, 41º48'42"W, 2769 m], 24 September 1941, fr., ♀, A.C. Brade 17005 (RB);
12 February 1996, fl., ♀, L.S. Leoni 3195 (CARAN).
Discussion:—Unfortunately, no staminate specimens were available to provide the characters of the male
plants of the new species. Baccharis magnifica appears to be related to Baccharis sect. Oblongifoliae Candolle
(1836: 416), where the morphologically similar B. macrophylla is placed due to the combination of paleate
clinanthium, flat paleae, few-ribbed cypselae and the pappus not elongated at cypsela maturity. However, due to the
lack of male specimens, which bear characters important for infrageneric placement, such as the shape of the style
apex and length of the sweeping hairs, any attempt to place the new species in an infrageneric framework would be
pointless.
In habit, expanded leaves, terminal capitulescence, paleate clinanthium of female capitula and short-rayed
female corollas, Baccharis magnifica resembles the allopatric B. macrophylla Dusén (1903: 14), endemic to the
southerly Serra da Mantiqueira in the border area of Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo states and only
known for the Serra do Itatiaia (MG/RJ border) and Serra Fina (MG/SP border). The new species can be
distinguished by its longer petioles (1.7–3 cm long), chartaceous leaf blades with rounded base and entire, flat and
ciliate leaf margins, smaller female capitula (3.7–4.3 mm long), and smaller female corollas (1.3–1.6 mm long) and

styles (1.6–1.8 mm long), whereas B. macrophylla presents shorter petioles (0.3–0.9 cm long), coriaceous leaf
blades with attenuate base and revolute, non-ciliate margins with 1–5 subapical teeth in the upper 1/3, larger female
capitula (5–6 mm long), and longer female corollas (2–2.6 mm long) and styles (2.5–3.5 mm long).
