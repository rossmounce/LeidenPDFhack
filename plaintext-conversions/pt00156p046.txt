Abstract
A new legume species, Weberbauerella chilensis, from the Andean foothills in the Tarapacá region in Chile, is described
and illustrated. This species represents the first record of the genus in Chile and the Southern Cone of South America and
is the third species described for the genus. Weberbauerella chilensis resembles W. brongnartioides from Peru, but
differs primarily in its smaller size, fewer leaflets and habitat conditions.
Key words: Chile, Tarapacá, Perú, new taxon, Weberbauerella, Atacama Desert

Introduction
During several field flora studies in the Andean foothills of northern Chile, a Fabaceae-Papilionoideae species was
collected that did not belong to any genus known to occur in Chile (Muñoz-Pizarro 1966, Marticorena & Quezada
1985, Marticorena 1990) nor to any other known genus in the Southern Cone of South America (Zuloaga et al.
2008a, b). Instead, the morphological features of these specimens indicate that it is a member of the Peruvian genus
Weberbauerella Ulbrich (1906: 551).
The genus Weberbauerella was erected with Weberbauerella brongniartioides Ulbrich (1906: 551), based on
specimens that Weberbauer collected in 1902 in areas associated with the Lomas formation (oasis de neblina in
Chile) on the southern Peruvian coast near Mollendo. Weberbauerella raimondiana Ferreyra (1951: 2), was the
second species described within the genus. This species is also associated with the Lomas formation and is found
near Chala on the Peruvian coast. This genus, characterized by the presence of pustular glands on stems, leaves and
flowers, one or few tubers and subshrub or herbaceous habit, has been considered, until now, to be the only
Fabaceae genus that is endemic to Peru and its only two known species are considered endangered (Baldeón et al.
2006). Weberbauerella has been treated within the subtribe Poiretiinae (tribe Aeschynomeneae), together with
genera Amicia Kunth, Poiretia Vent. and Zornia J.F.Gmel. (Rudd 1981). However, currently, and based on
molecular analysis of the "dalbergioid legumes", these genera form a monophyletic group within the clade
Adesmia, phylogenetically separated from Weberbauerella (Lavin et al. 2001), which is considered an isolated
genus within the Dalbergia clade of the tribe Dalbergieae s.l. (Klitgaard & Lavin 2005).
Although the Weberbauerella specimens collected in Chile perfectly align with Ulbrich’s (1906) description of
the genus, their morphological, geographical, and environmental differences from the two known species of
Weberbauerella are substantial enough to recognize a third, presently undescribed species of this genus.

slightly hairy, conspicuously dotted-glandular; seeds one per article, 3 × 2.2 mm, reniform, laterally flattened,
black, glabrous, glossy.
Habitat and distribution:—Weberbauerella chilensis is found in the Atacama Desert in the Tarapacá region
on a narrow altitudinal strip in the upper boundaries of absolute desert. This species grows on sandy soils between
2500 to 3600 meters altitude. It only appears above ground after precipitation, which is infrequent and irregular.
Weberbauerella chilensis grows in open habitats that include other annual or geophyte ephemeral herbaceous
species such as Metharme lanata Phil. (Zygophyllaceae), Nolana tarapacana (Phil.) I.M.Johnst. (Nolanaceae), and
Tiquilia grandiflora (Phil.) A.T.Richardson (Boraginaceae).
Etymology:—The specific epithet refers to Chile, where W. chilensis is found.
Phenology:—Flowering from September to March.
Conservation Status:—W. chilensis can be considered as Endangered (EN) under the IUCN (2012) categories
and criteria B1ab(iii), since it is known only from a few locations and has a small area of occupancy, and because
habitat loss is a latent threat, mainly from mining expansion.

Discussion:—The diagnostic characters of the genus Weberbauerella are mainly the presence of one or more
deep tubers, stems, leaves and flowers densely covered with pustular glands, and imparipinnate leaves (Ulbrich
1906) with more than 40 leaflets (Lavin et al. 2001). The number of leaflets is not a morphological character
mentioned in the protologue of the genus, however it is one of the diagnostic characters established here for W.

Figure 3 shows that the known populations of W. chilensis are located ca. 600 km from its two congeneric
species, which are only known from the area close to their type localities. In addition, there are large environmental
differences between the species. Weberbauerella brongnartioides and W. raimondiana are endemics restricted to
Lomas formations below 400 m at the arid desert coast (León et al. 1996) in southern Perú (Baldeon et al. 2006).
These two species are located phytogeographically within the Arequipeño sector (Galan de Mera et al. 1997) and
have a marked dependence on ENSO events (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) for their proper development. In
contrast, W. chilensis is a pre-Andean desert element in habitats under a strong influence of ‘La Niña’ events,
which is an inverse climatic phenomenon.
