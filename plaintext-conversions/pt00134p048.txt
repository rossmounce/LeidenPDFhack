Abstract
Nymphaea vanildae (Nymphaeaceae) is described and illustrated as a new species from the Caatinga region in Brazil,
and placed in Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis. This species is characterized by having nocturnal flowers, elliptic and
delicate leaves, a clear distinction between the perianth and androecium, linear carpellary appendages and four or more
series of proliferate pseudanthia, which distinguishes it from all species in the genus.
Key words: Aquatic plants, carpellary appendages, proliferate pseudanthium, water lily

Resumo
Nymphaea vanildae (Nymphaeaceae) é descrita e ilustrada como uma nova espécie do Brasil, do Bioma Caatinga, e
incluída em Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis. É caracterizada por ter flores noturnas, pelo limbo foliar elíptico e
membranáceo; distinção evidente entre o perianto e o androceu, apêndices carpelares lineares e a presença de quatro ou
mais séries de pseudanto-proliferantes, o que a distingue de qualquer outra espécie dentro do gênero.
Palavras-chave: Apêndice carpelar, nenúfar, pseudanto-proliferante, planta aquática

Introduction
The genus Nymphaea Linnaeus (1753: 510) includes ca. 50 species with a cosmopolitan distribution. This
number represents more than half of the species in Nymphaeales, which comprise the Nymphaeaceae,
Cabombaceae and Hydatellaceae (Bosch et al. 2008, APG III 2009).
Species of Nymphaea are aquatic, perennial plants, with erect or horizontal underground stems, and
floating, elliptic to orbicular leaf blades with a sagittate base. The solitary flowers are emergent, with many
sepals, petals, stamens and carpels, united or free, and parietal or laminar placentation. Anthesis is diurnal or
nocturnal. Fruits are berrylike, developing under water (Caspery 1878, Conard 1905, Wiersema 1987, Lima
2011, Lima et al. 2012).
In Brazil 18 species of Nymphaea are currently recognised (Amaral 2010). Nine of these species occur in
the Caatinga of the Northeast, and six of them in Bahia (Lima et al. 2012). During fieldwork for a revision of
the Brazilian species of Nymphaea, a new species was collected in the Caatinga Biome in the southwestern
part of Pernambuco State.

rounded, vinaceous with cream apices and bases. Fruits not seen. Proliferate pseudanthia includes a primary
proliferate pseudanthium with 3–4 sepals green to chestnut-brown with red spots, with a short central stem, to
the apex with a new proliferate pseudanthium of second, third, fourth, fifth and/or sixth order.
Phenology and Floral Biology:—Collected in flower between January and March, in the area where the
type collection was made. In April a long drought affected the region and the lake completely dried up. Fruit
were not seen. The second collection of the species was in June in an area close to where the type collection
was made. The small lake was almost dry and the plants were dwarfed, due to the drought that continued at
least up to the end of the year. Each of these small plants developed from a single proliferate pseudanthium
that commenced vegetative growth.
Nymphaea vanildae has protogynous flowers with two nights of anthesis. On the first night the flowers
open around 8:00 pm and close at 11:00 pm. The flower emits a strong odour of acetone and the receptive
stigmatic region appears bright and moist. The carpel appendages and the stamens are perpendicular to the
surface of the water, and the anthers are closed. On the second night of anthesis the sepals and petals of the
flowers open at 7:00 pm, but the anthers remain closed and the carpel appendages cover the stigmatic region,
which appears dull and dry. At 8:00 pm the three series of the outer stamens are perpendicular to the water
surface and the anthers begin to release pollen grains. Also there is a change in the position of the inner series
of stamens and the anthers begin to release the pollen. Around midnight all the flowers are closed and they
tumble over the water, starting the process of decomposition. This procedure is indicative of the absence of
pollination, since in all species of Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis (Planchon) Conard (1905: 200) the flower
closes after pollination and the peduncle bends and submerges the flower, after which the fruit will develop.
Habitat and distribution:—Nymphaea vanildae is restricted to a small area in a temporary small lake
near the São Francisco River, in Pernambuco State (Fig. 3). The two other species of the genus common in the
same region are Nymphaea lasiophylla Mart. & Zucc. in Zuccarini (1832: 364) and N. pulchella De Candolle
(1821: 51), the first occurring sympatrically with N. vanildae.
Etymology:—The specific epithet was chosen to commemorate the late Maria Vanilda Morais Oliveira,
technician in the Plant Taxonomy Laboratory of the Universidade Estadual de Feira de Santana, who, for
many years, supported teachers and students taking various botany courses. She was an enthusiastic amateur
botanist and took a special interest in plants of medicinal use.

Additional specimens examined (paratypes):—Brazil. Pernambuco: Santa Maria da Boa Vista, BR 122

(HUEFS!, B!, K!, CEPEC!). Pernambuco: Santa Maria da Boa Vista, BR 428 road, Km 76. 25 June 1982 (st.),
J. Wiersema et al. 2296 (IPA!).
Affinities and notes on critical characters:—Nymphaea vanildae has flowers with nocturnal anthesis,
the petals are not spirally arranged, the ovary is syncarpic and has a Neotropical distribution, therefore it is
included in Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis, sensu Wiersema (1987). The species can be characterized by the
vegetative morphology, with elliptic, membranaceous to subcoriaceous leaves that have a green chestnutbrown coloration and vinaceous spots, and brittle petiole. Such characters differentiate this species from the
two other water lilies occurring in this semiarid region.
The clear distinction between perianth and androecium and the presence of a proliferating pseudanthium
associates N. vanildae with N. lasiophylla and N. lingulata Wiersema (1984: 214). Both species are widely

distributed in the semiarid region (Fig. 4). Nymphaea vanildae presents 18–21 petals which distinguish it from
N. lingulata with 8–14 petals, but N. lasiophylla presents 16–26 petals. Nymphaea vanildae is distinguished
from these species by the presence of a primary proliferating pseudanthium with four to six secondary
proliferating pseudanthia, while N. lasiophylla and N. lingulata present only one or two secondary
proliferating pseudanthia. Nymphaea vanildae also has linear carpellary appendages, unlike other species of
Nymphaea subg. Hydrocallis, where the appendages are lingulate or clavate.
Due to the presence of proliferating pseudanthia with more than three series, N. vanildae is similar to N.
prolifera Wiersema, a species described as occurring from northern Argentina to Central America (Wiersema
1984). Both have similar coloration and numbers of sepals, in both the flowers and the pseudanthia. Analysis
of the specimens Walter 136 (K), Pedersen 8094 (K), 7743 (K) and 8335 (K), all cited by Wiersema (1984),
showed that N. prolifera possesses flowers with strongly clavate carpellary appendages and 3 to 4 series of
proliferating pseudanthia alternating spirally with series of leaves, as well as ovate leaves lacking spots on the
lamina, whereas N. vanildae has elliptic leaves, the lamina strongly spotted and with linear carpellary
appendages.
The combination of the above-mentioned characters makes N. vanildae a unique species from any other in
the genus.

LIMA & GIULIETTI

Note:—Wiersema et al. 2296 (IPA) was collected in SW Pernambuco and was identified as a natural
hybrid between Nymphaea amazonum subsp. amazonum and N. lasiophylla. Wiersema (1987) stated that this
conclusion was based on morphological and chemical evidence. Our analysis of Wiersema et al. 2296 shows it
is conspecific with Nymphaea vanildae. In our morphological analyses, few characters of Nymphaea vanildae
matched those of N. amazonum subsp. amazonum. Furthermore, no populations of N. amazonum subsp.
amazonum and N. lasiophylla occur sympatrically in the Caatinga. However, new studies on the reproductive
biology and molecular analyses are in progress to identify whether Nymphaea vanildae is be of hybrid origin,
and if so, which parental species would be involved.
Conservation status:—This species is estimated to be Critically Endangered (CR B1 ab), with
occurrence estimated to be less than 100 km2 in an extremely fragmented area. The lakes in the semiarid
region, particularly in the Caatinga, are a priority for conservation in Northeast Brazil, especially with the
current level of ongoing anthropogenic disturbance.
