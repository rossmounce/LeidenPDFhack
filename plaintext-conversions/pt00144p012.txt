Abstract
Two new combinations are proposed in Oxybasis (Chenopodioideae, Chenopodiaceae or Amaranthaceae s.l.).
Chenopodium micranthum, described from Russia in the 1860s and known as C. urbicum subsp. sinicum in China, is
assigned specific rank in Oxybasis. It appears to be widespread in China, Mongolia, Kazakhstan and Asiatic Russia. The
Siberian-Mongolian C. gubanovii, recently described as a new species in Chenopodium sect. Pseudoblitum, is also
assigned to Oxybasis. Molecular phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP)
methods confirmed the placement of C. micranthum and C. gubanovii in the genus Oxybasis. Distribution maps of O.
micrantha and O. gubanovii are provided, the latter species being reported for the first time in the Chinese part of the
Altai Mountains. A lectotype for C. micranthum (= O. micrantha) is designated.
Key words: Chenopodiaceae, Chenopodium, China, distribution, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russia, taxonomy

Introduction
Recent molecular phylogenetic studies (Kadereit et al. 2003, 2010, Fuentes-Bazan et al. 2012a) showed that
the genus Chenopodium Linnaeus (1753: 218) is polyphyletic, and its representatives have been placed in
several genera in the tribes Chenopodieae, incl. Atripliceae Duby (1828: 394), Anserineae Dumortier (1827:
20) and Dysphanieae Pax (1889: 92). The taxa earlier included in Chenopodium sect. Pseudoblitum (Grenier
& Godron (1855: 22) Syme (1868: 20) have been reassigned to the genus Oxybasis Karelin & Kirilov (1841:
738) [O. glauca (Linnaeus (1753: 220) S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, O. rubra (Linnaeus (1753: 218)
S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, O. chenopodioides (Linnaeus (1771: 170) S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, O. urbica
(L.) S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch, and O. macrospema (Hooker (1846: 341) S.Fuentes, Uotila & Borsch].
Mosyakin (2013) divided Oxybasis into four sections and added two species. Furthermore, Mosyakin (2013)
and Verloove (2013) proposed new combinations for some infraspecific taxa belonging to O. glauca and O.
rubra.
Oxybasis is characterised in having flowers with a hyaline or greenish perianth of 2–4(–5) free or connate
segments, a reduced number of stamens (2–4, rarely 5) and usually red seeds with the outer layer (testa)
impregnated with tannin-like substances and a diversely oriented seed embryo (see also Fuentes-Bazan et al.
2012b, and Sukhorukov & Zhang 2013). However, some members of Chenopodium s.l. remain poorly known
and their correct placement is still pending. In the present article we transfer two Asiatic taxa, C. gubanovii

Sukhorukov (1999: 493) and C. urbicum subsp. sinicum H.W. Kung & G.L. Chu (Kung et al. 1978: 121), from
Chenopodium s.l. to Oxybasis.

Material and methods
Morphological and anatomical studies
Specimens from the herbaria B, BM, E, G, H, K, KAS, LE, MHA, MOSP, MW, PE, PVB, TLT, XJA,
XJBI (abbreviations according to Thiers 2008+) and the herbarium of Xinjiang Medicinal Institute (Urumqi)
were revised.
Anatomical cross-sections of fruits and seeds were cut by hand. Prior to scanning electron microscopy
(SEM), material was dehydrated in aqueous ethyl alcohol solutions of increasing concentration and then in
alcohol-acetone solutions and pure acetone. Observations were made using a JSM-6380 (JEOL Ltd., Japan)
SEM at 15 kV after critical-point drying and sputter coating with gold-palladium. Non-dehydrated dry fruits
were also examined for comparison of pericarp structure. Carpological terms used are according to Werker
(1997).
DNA studies
Phylogenetic analysis
The phylogenetic analysis was made using ITS1 sequences from specimens of O. micrantha and O. gubanovii
(present work) coupled with NCBI data. Polygonum aviculare Linnaeus (1753: 362) was used as an outgroup.
The aligned ITS1 length was 187 bp. DNA was extracted from the leaves of herbarium specimens of O.
micrantha and O. gubanovii and molecular sequences obtained for the nuclear ITS1 region. Voucher
specimens and GenBank accession numbers are as follows:
Oxybasis micrantha: China, Burjin, woodland, 25 August 1986, Xiaoqiang Ma et al. 86-0694 sub
Chenopodium micranthum (XJA-00032767); ITS1, 5.8S RNA, ITS2, GenBank accession number KF514654;
Oxybasis gubanovii: Mongolia, Altay Mountains, valley of the Bulgan river, 35 km from Bulgan vill., 12
August 1982, I. A. Gubanov 5577 sub Chenopodium gubanovii (MW); ITS 1 GenBank accession number

DNA amplification and sequencing
For isolation of genomic DNA we used the modified method of Edwards et al. (1991). The ITS1 region
was amplified using the combination of the newly designed primers ITS5.1 (5’-TCG AAA CCT GCC TAG
CAG AGC-3’) and ITS4.1 (5’-CGC AAC TTG CGT TCA AAG ACT-3’) based on alignment of nrDNA
sequences comprising ITS1, 5,8S RNA and ITS2 from Oxybasis rubra [HE577382.1, HE577380.1,
HE577381.1, HE577385.1], O. glauca [HE577386.1, HE577387.1], O. urbica [HE577384.1, HE577383.1],
and O. chenopodioides [HE577379.1]. The DNA template was added to the reaction mixture at a final
concentration of 10 ng/ µl. The PCR program consisted of an initial denaturation step of 95°C for 5 min,
followed by 35 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, 52°C for 20 s and 72°C for 20s, and a final step of 72°C for 5 min.
Sequencing was performed using the same primers with an AbiPrism automated DNA sequencer ("Syntol",
Moscow).

Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
ITS sequences were aligned using BioEdit 7.1.3.0. To infer phylogenetic relationships the following
methods were used: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Maximum Parsimony (MP). All searches were carried
out using MEGA 5.1 (after Tamura et al. 2011). Branch support for MP and ML analyses was evaluated by
using the nonparametric bootstrap (1000 BS replicates). Bootstrap values < 70% are considered to be weak.
The MP tree was obtained using the Subtree-Pruning-Regrafting (SPR) algorithm with search level 1, in
which the initial trees were obtained by the random addition of sequences (10 replicates). The Maximum
Likelihood analysis was based on the Kimura 2-parameter model (Kimura 1980).

Taxonomy
1. Oxybasis micrantha (Trautv.) Sukhor. & Uotila, comb. nov.
Bas.: Chenopodium micranthum Trautvetter (1868: 464). Type (lectotype, here designated by Sukhorukov &
Uotila):―RUSSIA: Gubern. Orenburg, distr. Tscheljaba [Chelyabinsk prov.], 1868, Lossiewski 4980 (LE!) (Fig. 1).
= Chenopodium urbicum L. subsp. sinicum Kung & G.L.Chu in Kung et al. (1978: 121). Type (holotype):―CHINA:
Hopei [Hebei] prov., Beijing, Haihuisi, humid place, 9 October 1951, Li & Xu 0157 (PE-00024040!).
—Chenopodium stipitatum Aellen, in schedis.

Description:―Plants annual, up to 200 cm tall, glabrous. Stems angled and in part with prominent ridges,
yellowish, only sparingly branched in basal parts if at all. Petiole to 15 cm long in the basal leaves, much
shorter in the distal ones; blade thin, to 15(–30) cm long, longer than wide, triangular-hastate to trullate,
usually with broadly attenuate base and spreading to slightly forward pointing, up to about 1 cm long basal
lobe-like teeth; mid-lobe evenly tapering to acute apex, margins entire or with outward to slightly forward
pointing teeth, heterogenic in size. Leaves becoming progressively smaller and narrower apically with
uppermost bracts long, narrowly lanceolate and entire. Inflorescences mostly ebracteate, dense, spiciform,
moderately branched; branches erect, with some entire bracts; secondary branches short and dense;
glomerules 2–3 mm in diameter, loose. Flowers stipitate in fruit stage; stipes 0.2–0.5 mm. Perianth segments 5
(sometimes 4), divided almost to the base, adjacent segments not touching, brownish-greenish, margins and
apexes broadly membranous, mid-vein prominent and elevated inside; segments spreading and dimorphic at
fruit stage: about 0.6 mm long, 0.3–0.4 mm broad in the apical part and 0.2 mm in the basal part, obovate,
back without keel, and elongated, to 0.9 x 0.2 mm, lanceolate or oblanceolate, keel prominently swollen at
apical part. Stamens 4–5. Stigmas 2, short. Fruit 0.5–0.7(–0.9) x 0.5–0.6 x 0.2–0.3 mm, pericarp scraped off
the seed, transparent, one-layered, with mamillae to 30 μm (dry mamillae have crater-like outlines and regain
their structure after soaking). Seeds horizontal and sometimes vertical (spatial heterospermy), round in
outline, 0.6–0.8 mm in diameter, 0.3 mm thick, slightly convex, flat, red or reddish-black, margin keeled.
Outer seed coat layer (testa) lustrous, smooth or undulate, about 12 μm thick and with vertical stalactites,
inner layer (tegmen) about 1 μm; no differences were observed in testa thickness between fruits with diverse
diameters or spatial heterospermy. Embryo curved.
Distribution and habitat:―Oxybasis micrantha is widely distributed from the South Ural Mountains
(Chelyabinsk Prov., on the border of Europe) to the temperate Far East and eastern China (Fig. 2). This range
includes Kazakhstan, many provinces of Russia, Mongolia and northwestern and eastern China and
everywhere extends to a latitude of about 50–55° N. The gap in Central China and Mongolia may reflect both
a lack of suitable habitats and lower collecting activity.
The large distribution area is predominantly characterised by steppe and semi-desert, but surprisingly
many specimens of O. micrantha have been collected from moister habitats, e.g. “humid place” (type of C.
urbicum subsp. sinicum), “marsh”, “along stream”, “near the river” and “among reed” (C. stipitatum). There
are many finds also from saline localities and some specimens from places clearly strongly influenced by
human activity, e.g. “railway station”, “ruderal place” and “wasteland”. A general rarity of moist and saline
habitats may be one reason for the rarity of O. micrantha everywhere within its vast distribution area.

Taxonomical notes:―Chenopodium micranthum was well characterized by Trautvetter (1868), who
identified the two most important diagnostic features: the exceptionally small seeds and the spreading
perianth segments in the fruit stage. He listed the species 16 years later (Trautvetter 1884), but since then it
has been totally forgotten and omitted even from the synonymy of C. urbicum and other species (e.g., Iljin &
Aellen 1936 and all later Russian floras and checklists). Herbarium specimens from Russia and Central Asia
were in general determined as C. urbicum, and in some cases C. rubrum.

The second attempt to untangle this enigmatic taxon was made by the late Chenopodium specialist Paul
Aellen (1896–1973), who came across an unknown Chinese specimen loaned from K. He thought that it could
belong to a new species, wrote a preliminary description and added a determination slip “Chenopodium
stipitatum Aellen sp. n.; Aellen 1967”. He also removed a very small part of an inflorescence and some seeds
for his herbarium. In addition to the fragment in an envelope, sketches of the inflorescence and leaves were
mounted on sheet no. 24481 of Aellen’s Herbarium (now in G), and a handwritten German description of a
new species, C. stipitatum Aellen, was added. In 2011 another fragment of this specimen was found in B. For
some reason P. Aellen sent part of his fragment to Berlin, to Hildemar Scholz. In 2011 H. Scholz could recall
neither the history of this specimen, nor why it was sent to him.
Ten years later the taxon was described from China as a subspecies of Chenopodium urbicum (Kung et al.
1978). The original description of subsp. sinicum and the emended one in the Flora of China (Zhu et al. 2003)
also well characterize the taxon. However, this subspecies has never been identified outside of China. Before
the description of subsp. sinicum, the taxon was generally determined as C. urbicum in China, and sometimes
as C. hybridum. Recent Chinese collections have mostly been correctly determined, and it is reported from
many northern provinces in Zhu et al. (2003).

FIGURE 2. The distribution of Oxybasis micrantha (dots) based on the specimens seen, and O. gubanovii (triangles) based on
Sukhorukov (1999, 2002) as well as additional Chinese specimens seen.

The related O. urbica has not been well understood in the area, and in addition to O. micrantha many
exsiccata of Chenopodium urbicum actually belong to O. rubra or O. chenopodioides. Many specimens have
been collected in an early stage of development, and this may be a partial cause of misidentification. O. urbica
seems to be a rare alien plant in Eastern Siberia and the Russian Far East, and it is not yet reported from the
eastern provinces of China (Zhu et al. 2003). In the fruiting stage it is easily distinguished from O. urbica by
its small, stipitate flowers with 5 or 4 spreading, narrow perianth segments and the smaller seeds, which are
horizontal and vertical, reddish and keeled (Table 1). Although flowers are at first more or less sessile in both
species, in the fruiting stage they are usually distinctly stipitate in O. micrantha and ± sessile in O. urbica. In

the vegetative state O. micrantha is more difficult to recognize, because its leaf shape is quite variable. The
leaves are in general olive (not dark) green, and thinner and larger than those of O. urbica. Teeth are usually
only few in number and variable in size, sometimes lobe-like and often they have more acute apices and lobes.
The bases are broadly attenuate or cuneate to ± straight, but not over 180° as is common in O. urbica.

gubanovii is smaller, its leaves have entire margins and the seeds are almost always vertical. Important
differences from O. rubra include stipitate flowers, almost free perianth segments and more or less similar
terminal and lateral flowers in a glomerule.

features: basally branched stems, entire leaves and habit. However, the flowers are different. They are
characterized by 2–4 free perianth segments which become longer and thicker in the fruiting stage in O.
gubanovii, while in the other species the perianth is more or less lobed and unchanged in fruit. The pericarp is
hardly able to be scraped off from the seed coat and the seeds are vertical, with keeled margins (for a more
detailed description and illustration, see Sukhorukov 1999). The carpology of this taxon is studied and
discussed by Sukhorukov & Zhang (2013).
Distribution:―Oxybasis gubanovii is known only from Central Asia (Mongolian and Russian Altai,
southern Siberia and Eastern Kazakhstan), with isolated finds from the Kazakh Uplands (Sukhorukov 1999,
2002). Its frequency is uncertain, but it is a fairly common weed in some parts of Mongolia (Alexander Ebel
& Natalya Rudaya, pers. comm.). Now we report it also from the Chinese Altai (Fig. 2).
Taxonomic notes:―Sukhorukov (1999) described C. gubanovii as a member of Chenopodium sect.
Pseudoblitum, but Fuentes-Bazan et al. (2012b) did not transfer it to Oxybasis because the perianth lobes
deviate slightly from those found in other species of sect. Pseudoblitum, and resemble to some extent those of
the morphologically very variable genus Blitum. Subsequently, the affinity to Oxybasis was demonstrated by
fruit and seed anatomy: carpological traits, especially seed characters such as red colour and impregnation of
tannin-like substances (stalactites) in the outer seed coat (testa) cells correspond well with other species of
Oxybasis (Sukhorukov & Zhang 2013).
Additional specimens examined:―CHINA. Xinjiang: Altay Beitun, grassland, 30 August 1964, Chu et
al. 7021 (PE-00540075); Fuyun, 28 August 1980, sine col. s.n. (herb. Xinjiang Medicinal Institute). The
Chinese specimens were originally determined as C. urbicum.

Discussion
The inclusion of C. urbicum in the genus Oxybasis may seem incongruous due to the presence of black seeds
with a horizontal embryo (Sukhorukov & Zhang 2013), but the morphologically most closely related species,
O. micrantha, combines characters of O. urbica with those more typical of members of Oxybasis (presence of
both vertical and horizontal seeds in a single individual, red seed colour, presence of mamillae on the
pericarp). In the MP phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4), O. urbica appears in a clade (bootstrap value 79%) with O.
gubanovii + other related Oxybasis species with hyaline perianth segments (O. chenopodioides, O. rubra, and
O. micrantha). In the ML phylogenetic tree (Fig. 5), both O. gubanovii and O. micrantha form a clade with O.
chenopodioides and O. rubra with moderate bootstrap support (76%). In both the MP and ML phylogenetic
analyses, Oxybasis gubanovii and O. micrantha form a clade with other Oxybasis species with high bootstrap
support (MP 90%, ML 99%). The sectional division of Oxybasis proposed by Mosyakin (2013) needs to be
clarified using all species of the genus.
The morphological delimitation of the taxa with (almost) free hyaline segments is difficult. The most
valuable characters for identifying all the species related to O. rubra are seen at the fruiting stage and are
connected with the perianth (which may be enlarged or otherwise), and with the fruit and seed characters. The
table 1 shows the diagnostic characters useful for identification of the species within the group. However,
there is one further Central and Western European taxon of uncertain affinity, C. intermedium Mertens &
W.D.J. Koch (1826: 297) recently combined as Oxybasis rubra var. intermedia by Bock & Tison (2012),
which requires further investigation.
