Abstract
Utricularia julianae, a new species from the savannas near the Oyapock River, French Guiana, is here described and
illustrated. The new species is most similar to U. tenuissima, from which it can be easily distinguished by the leaves and
stolons apparently lacking (vs. leaves few and on the stolons, the stolons few or lacking, in U. tenuissima), traps
ellipsoid, 0.3 mm long, with 4–5 capilliform appendages (vs. ovoid, 0.3–0.8 mm long, with 1 dorsal and 2 ventral slender
appendages), corolla upper lip limb deeply bilobed (vs. broadly ovate to round), spur saccate, perpendicular to the lower
lip (vs. spur narrowly cylindrical, parallel to the lower lip), among other characters. In addition, the capsules of U.
julianae and U. tenuissima are unique within the genus, by being very narrowly ovoid, dehiscing by a single longitudinal
slit, and with a placenta projecting outside the dehisced capsule. On the basis of their numerous morphological
similarities and their peculiar capsule shape and dehiscence, the new species is tentatively placed within sect. Martinia,
which P. Taylor described to accommodate U. tenuissima.

Introduction
The genus Utricularia Linnaeus (1753: 18) comprises ca. 220 species worldwide (Müller et al. 2006). According to
the most recent checklist produced for the Guiana Shield (Taylor 2007), 34 species of Utricularia are present in the
Guianas (Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana). The classic treatment for identifying species of this genus is the
worldwide monograph published by Taylor (1989), who dedicated most of his life towards this endeavor.
Additional regional references (i.e., Guayana Highlands, Venezuelan Guayana) for identification of Utricularia
species were also provided by the same author (Taylor 1967, 1999).
Recent molecular phylogenies (Müller et al. 2005; Müller & Borsh, 2005) confirmed that the three genera
traditionally recognized in the family Lentibulariaceae, namely Pinguicula Linnaeus (1753: 17), Genlisea SaintHilaire (1833: 428) and Utricularia, are monophyletic. Also, Taylor (1989) recognized two subgenera in
Utricularia: subgenus Utricularia, with two calyx lobes, and subgenus Polypompholyx (Lehmann 1844: 109)
Taylor (1986: 1), with four calyx lobes; however this subdivision is not supported by molecular phylogenies
(Müller & Borsh, 2005).
The genus most closely related to Utricularia is Genlisea, which is characterized by its “Y-shaped, twisted,
subterrestrial eel traps used to attract and trap protozoa” (Barthlott et al. 1998; Müller et al. 2005), whereas
Utricularia “exhibits the most complex trapping device, among the most complicated leaf modifications known in
the plant kingdom. The bladder traps of Utricularia are either submerged or subterrestrial and work by means of
low pressure” (Müller et al. 2005). Additionally, the flowers of Utricularia are easily distinguished from those of
Genlisea by the 2- or 4-lobed calyx (vs. 5-lobed in Genlisea) (Müller et al. 2006, Taylor 1999).
During a recent expedition to the savannas near the Oyapock River, French Guiana, a small, white-flowered
species of Utricularia was discovered. Although I performed considerable field work in the coastal savannas of
French Guiana over the last four years, this species was never seen before. Additionally, the Savane Jardin Caché,

where this plant was collected, is poorly known, mostly because it is difficult to reach. The first collecting
expedition to this savanna was made by canoe, on 17 July 2010, going ca. 5 km downstream from Saint-George de
l’Oyapock on the Oyapock River, and then walking 4 km through inundated lowland forest. A second expedition
was made by helicopter, on 7 June 2013. It was during the second expedition that the here described new species of
Utricularia was discovered. The name Savane “Jardin Caché” (meaning “hidden garden” due to the diversity and
abundance of flowers present, and the high density and diversity of bees visiting the flowers) was given by the
participating members of the first expedition (Ruth Bone, Gina Lolli, Helene Richard, and myself) because up to
that moment this locality was still unnamed; so, this is also the first publication wherein this savanna is officially
named. Due to its peculiar nature (black and white sand of granitic origin, located near the Oyapock River) and its
unique floristic composition, efforts will be undertaken by the organization Conservatoire du Littoral to acquire
this site and to place it under the status of protected area.

Material and Methods
This study was based on field observations and examinations of herbarium specimens collected at the Savane
Jardin Caché, French Guiana (France). Herbarium specimens were deposited at the CAY, K and US herbaria. A few
specimens preserved in 70% ethanol are also deposited at CAY, to facilitate the study of vegetative and
reproductive parts of this minute species. Dried and pickled specimens were examined using a dissecting
microscope. Conservation status was assessed applying the IUCN Red list Categories and Criteria version 3.1
(IUCN 2001).

that helicopter flights are dangerous. For these reasons, this rare, minute and precious species is dedicated to her.

Distribution, Habitat and Ecology:—The only collection known of this species is from Savane Jardin Caché
(a few km by air from the Oyapock River), an open field savanna dominated by Poaceae, Cyperaceae, with
frequent patches of Eriocaulaceae, and surrounded by primary forest. The observed small population, consisting of
no more than 50 individuals, was growing in the semi-shade of the surrounding forest. The soil of the savanna is
composed of coarse, salt-and-pepper sand (black and white grains) of granitic origin. The savanna is subjected to
the two main seasons present in French Guiana: the dry season (from August to November) and the rainy season
(from December to July). At the time of the collection, it was towards the end of the rainy season, when the soil of
the savanna was soaked in water, but not inundated. Considering the small size of the individuals and their
environmental condition, this species is doubtless ephemeral, and with a life span of just a few weeks. The single
flowering collection was made in June.
Suggested conservation status:—This species is up to now only known from a single population of no more
than 50 individuals, indicating that it is very rare. After four years of intense collecting in the coastal savannas of
French Guiana, this is the first time that it has been seen; however, there is a small probability that it might have
been overlooked, due to the small size of the individuals and its ephemeral life span. Therefore, taking into account
the small area of occupancy and the small population observed this species should be treated as “Critically
Endangered” (CR) following IUCN D criterium (IUCN 2001).
Taxonomic relationships:—According to the dichotomous keys and descriptions provided by Taylor (1967:
207–209, 214; 1989: 67–73, 261), the most similar species to Utricularia julianae is U. tenuissima Tutin (1934:
334). However, it can be distinguished from the latter (as described and illustrated by Taylor 1989: 261, fig. 67, and
by Fernández-Pérez 1964: 52, fig. 16) by the leaves and stolons apparently lacking (vs. stolons few or absent,
leaves few, on the stolons in U. tenuissima), traps ellipsoid, 0.3 mm long, laterally attached, with 4–5 capilliform
appendages (vs. ovoid, 0.3–0.8 mm long, basally attached, with 1 dorsal and 2 ventral, slender appendages), calyx
lobes 1-veined (vs. 5-veined), calyx lower lobe retuse at apex (vs. bidentate at apex), corolla upper lip limb deeply
bilobed, with lobes oblong, 1–1.2 mm long (vs. broadly ovate to round), corolla lower lip limb broadly ovate, with
shallowly undulate to obviously crenulate margin (vs. round, with entire or minutely crenulate margin), spur
narrowly cylindrical, parallel to the lower lip (vs. saccate, perpendicular to the lower lip), and the stigmatic
branches unequal, ovate, acute at apex (vs. subequal, round, obtuse at apex). A comparative summary of the
characters that differentiate these two taxa is presented in Table 1.

It is worth noting that as concerns U. tenuissima there is a certain discrepancy between the description and
illustration provided by Taylor and the type specimens. In fact, Taylor (1989: 261, fig. 67) described and illustrated
U. tenuissima as having the spur parallel to the lower corolla limb lip, a feature noted by Tutin when he collected
the type material, whereas the type specimens (Tutin 644, BM!, K!, L!, NY!) have the spur perpendicular to the
lower limb lip.
The capsules of Utricularia tenuissima and U. julianae are quite similar by being very narrowly ovoid,
dehiscing by a single longitudinal slit, and by having a shortly stipitate placenta that is projected outside the
dehisced capsule. On the basis of these numerous morphological similarities, and their capsule shape and
dehiscence unique within the genus, the new species is provisionally placed in sect. Martinia Taylor (1986: 7),
which was described to accommodate U. tenuissima. Further phylogenetic analyses will eventually test this
placement and the monophyly of this section.
