Abstract
Pleurostachys arcuata is described as a new species endemic to the Atlantic forest of Brazil. It is illustrated and is
compared to other species of Pleurostachys. It has the large achenes of P. macrantha but has small, axillary
synflorescences similar to those of P. gaudichaudii.

Introduction
Pleurostachys Brongn. is a small genus found exclusively in neotropical forests. Kükenthal’s monograph of
1952 treated 30 species. Thomas and Alves (2008) recognized 23 species, 21 of which are endemic to
Brazil’s Atlantic coastal forest. Modern collections have greatly increased the number of specimens available
for study, revealing several undescribed species, one of which is described here.
Most authors have maintained Pleurostachys as a separate genus closely allied to Rhynchospora Vahl
(Boeckler, 1875; Clarke, 1908; Pfeiffer, 1925; Koyama, 1961; Kükenthal, 1952; Eiten, 1976; Bruhl, 1995;
Goetghebeur, 1986, 1998; Soros & Bruhl, 2000). Recent molecular studies (Thomas et al. 2009a) confirm
this relationship and raise the question as to whether or not Rhynchospora is paraphyletic with respect to
Pleurostachys. Because the phylogenetic relationship of Pleurostachys and Rhynchospora is still unclear, and
because they are morphologically distinct, we are describing this new species as a member of the genus
Pleurostachys.
Features that unite Rhynchospora and Pleurostachys in the tribe Rhynchosporeae include simple
spikelets, bisexual flowers, lenticular achenes subtended by perianth bristles, and a persistent style base.
Characters that distinguish Pleurostachys from Rhynchospora include an inflorescence comprising a series of
axillary synflorescences, distichously (or subdistichously) arranged spikelet scales, distally plumose perianth
bristles, and decurrent style bases (these are discussed at length in Thomas & Alves, 2008).

Taxonomy
Pleurostachys arcuata W. W. Thomas, M. Alves & R. Trevis., spec. nov. (Fig. 1)
Pleurostachys arcuata is unique in having basal leaves which are long and wide, small synflorescences of clustered
spikelets, and large achenes. It has the large achenes of P. macrantha but has the small, axillary synflorescences of
P. gaudichaudii.
Type:—Brazil. Bahia: Mun. Santa Luzia, Serra da Onça, 10.8 km NE of Santa Luzia (30 km SW of Una) on Una-Santa
Luzia road, then 4.2 km N on road to Serra da Onça. 39°30’S, 15°20’W. Southern Bahian Wet Forest. Reddish clay
and many rocks. Rare in forest, leaves shiny dark green, inflorescence arching to scandent. 21 Nov 1996. W. W.
Thomas, A. Carvalho, A. Amorim, S. Sant’Ana & J. L. Paixão 11367 (holotype CEPEC, isotypes K, NY).

Description
Perennial, cespitose or with short woody rhizomes. Culms arching, (30.5–) 58–212 cm long, (1–) 1.8–3
mm wide at lowest synflorescence, tapering to 0.8 –1 mm below distal-most synflorescence, glabrous,
triangular in cross-section. Leaves basal and cauline; basal leaves ca. 5 –7 with open sheaths; sheaths
gradually widening into the blade, paler than blade, plicate, 12–15 × 1.4–1.8 cm; blade lanceolate to linear, 15–
90 × 2–2.4 cm, dark green, usually shiny, the apex acuminate, the margins slightly antrorsely scabrous; cauline
leaves (bracts) each subtending an axillary synflorescence and diminishing in size distally along the culm;
sheaths closed, the basal ones 2–4 cm long. Synflorescences 4–8, each a condensed raceme of 3–6 clusters of
2–3 spikelets each, mature basal one 1.4–3.5 × 1.5–3 cm, the peduncles decreasing in length at each more
distal node, the basal one 6.5–8 cm long. Spikelets 10–20 per synflorescence; 3.7 × 2.9 mm at anthesis,
lenticular, ovate in outline, pale brown; scales ca. 8 visible, distichously or subdistichously arranged, carinate,
shiny, cartilaginous, the lowest 2–3 sterile, the lower ones mucronate, the intermediate ones largest, shallowly
triangular, 2.8 × 3.5 mm. Perianth bristles persistent, 5, flattened basally, antrorsely scabrous to shortplumose, unequal, (1–) 1.5–2.4 mm long, usually one half to two thirds the length of the achene. Achenes 2.4–
3.2 × (1.7–) 2.2–2.9 mm, deeply biconvex, broadly obovate to circular in outline, shiny, lightly wrinkled to
obscurely rugulose; style base inserted in a shallow depressed area at apex of achene and decurrent along
lateral margins, the depressed area transversely rhombic, 0.9–1.2 × (1.7–) 2–2.5 mm, the raised central portion
0.6–1.2 × 0.8–1.0 mm, deltate.
Distribution and ecology:—Known from the Atlantic forest region of Brazil, from the state of Bahia south
to the state of Santa Catarina (Fig. 2). The known collections are from tropical submontane moist forest (Thomas
& Barbosa 2008) above 300 m in Bahia and Espírito Santo and below 300 m in Rio de Janeiro and Santa
Catarina, usually among rocks. The flora of one locality, the Serra do Teimoso (Fig. 3), has been well-studied
(Amorim et al. 2005) and a study of the species composition shows that the forest near the top of the mountain,
where Pleurostachys arcuata was collected, is distinct from that of the lower forests (Thomas et al. 2009b).
Etymology:—The species is named for its characteristic arched culms.
Conservation Status:—Pleurostachys arcuata is restricted to intact, rocky, submontane moist forests,
and is never common. Furthermore, the Atlantic forest of Brazil has been identified as one of the World’s
biodiversity “hotspots” (Myers et al. 2000), in part, because of continuing deforestation. Overall, the Atlantic
forest has been reduced to less than 11 percent of its original extent (Ribeiro et al. 2009).
Calculating “area of occupancy” (AOO; IUCN 2012) using grid cells of 3 × 3 km (9 km2) following the
methodology developed by Callmander et al. (2007) and Miller & Porter Morgan (2011) results in an AOO
for P. arcuata of 126 km2. Calculating “extent of occurrence” (EOO; IUCN 2012) results in an EOO of ca.
160,000 km2 (the 1600 km between the northernmost and southernmost known localities multiplied by the
average width of the Atlantic forest, ca. 100 km). The AOO estimate is probably too restrictive and does not
take into account areas where the species probably occurs but has never been collected. The EOO estimate,
on the other hand, is too broad and does not factor in range discontinuity, habitat specificity, or deforestation.
We believe the most accurate reflection of its conservation status would be an IUCN Red List category of
Vulnerable (VU). More collections would probably increase the AOO of P. arcuata significantly, but to less
than 2000 km 2 . Furthermore, it occurs in a severely fragmented biome, one that continues to suffer
deforestation that will diminish the number and location of its subpopulations.

Observations:—In Kükenthal’s (1952) classification, Pleurostachys arcuata would belong to section
Millegranae (Thomas & Alves 2008) because of the presence of blades on the basal leaves and the congested
synflorescences. In their phylogeny of Pleurostachys based on morphological characters, however, Thomas
and Alves (2008) found that section Millegranae was probably polyphyletic, and that P. arcuata (designated
as “sp. nov. 1”) was sister to all other species of the genus.
The only other species with achenes similar in size to those of Pleurostachys arcuata is P. macrantha
Kunth with achenes 2.8–3.4 × 2.7–3.2 mm. Pleurostachys macrantha, however, has large, open panicles with
solitary spikelets at the end of each branch. The remaining species of Pleurostachys have achenes
approximately 1 mm long or less.
