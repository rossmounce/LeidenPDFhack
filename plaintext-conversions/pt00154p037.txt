Abstract
We describe 22 new species of Gomphoneis, and report several previously described taxa, from historical and recently
made collections from Lake Baikal, Russia. We use light microscopy to document all taxa, and scanning electron
microscopy to illustrate several of the species from the lake. All of the species present in Lake Baikal are part of the
Elegans subgroup of the genus. Despite previous reports, we could find no representatives of the Herculeana subgroup in
Baikal. We provide comparisons between the taxa, and document variability in the features found in the species. Two
groups within the Elegans subgroup are present; most have 4 (or more) stigmoids, while a minority of the species lack
stigmoids. We suggest that the species in Lake Baikal have two origins; one from the West, where an arc of related
species spans Mongolia, NW China to Macedonia, and the second from western North America. Radiation of the two
groups has resulted in species flocks. The number of Gomphoneis species in Lake Baikal is the largest number of species
of the genus anywhere in the world.

Introduction
The diatom genus Gomphoneis was described by Cleve (1894: 73) for the species previously assigned to the
genus Gomphonema, but with longitudinal lines and doubly-punctate striae. Initially, the genus was comprised
mostly of fossil taxa and those from western North America as well as ‚ÄúKamtschatka‚Äù (Cleve 1894, pp. 73‚Äì4;
Grunow in Van Heurck 1880). Boyer (1927) designated the generitype of Gomphoneis as G. elegans (Grunow)
Cleve (1894: 73). Originally it was a small genus, with 3 taxa, and it remained relatively small for nearly 100
years. Perspectives on the genus changed in the 1970‚Äôs as observations of some species of ‚Äútypical‚Äù or wellknown Gomphonema Ehrenberg (1832: 87) species (such as G. olivaceum (Hornemann) Ehrenberg 1838: 218)
showed them with doubly-punctate striae and they were transferred to Gomphoneis (Dawson 1974; Ross &
Sims 1978). Krammer (in Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 1985), for example, noted Gomphonema
transylvanicum Pantocsek (1892: pl. 14, figs 219, 220), a species with doubly-punctate striae, typical porelli,
and marginal laminae and assigned this species to Gomphoneis. Kociolek and Stoermer reviewed the genus,
and contributed many new species (e.g. Kociolek & Stoermer 1986, 1988a, b) as well as described their
systematic relationships (Kociolek & Stoemer 1989). They indicated the genus had doubly-punctate striae and
in larger, more primitive species marginal laminae, which have been secondarily lost in smaller, more derived
species, a concept not well understood in the diatom taxonomy community (see, for example, the paper by
Reichardt 2007). They organized the genus into two subgroups. The first one has a stigma, doubly-punctate

striae, longitudinal lines created by axial plate (seen in valve view) and marginal laminae (seen in girdle view),
and other features similar to Gomphonema (apical pore fields, striae of the puncta). Included here are G.
herculeana (Ehrenberg) Cleve (1874: 73), G. eriense (Grunow) Skvortzow & Meyer (1928: 28) and their
closest allies (Kociolek & Stoermer 1988). The other group includes the generitype, G. elegans, and species in
this group have apical pore field porelli that are similar to the areolae, 4 or more stigmoids (simple openings
around the central area that may have siliceous ingrowths; versus stigmata with have round external openings
and slit-like internal openings, found in traditional Gomphonema taxa and the other subgroup of Gomphoneis),
or lack stigmoids altogether. More recently some members of this subgroup have been described from Lake
Ohrid (Levkov et al. 2007), and Tuji (2005) considered species from Japan.
The genus Gomphoneis has been reported previously from Lake Baikal. Wislouch (1924) described one
new variety from the lake. Skvortzow (in Skvortzow & Meyer 1928; 1937) and Meyer (1930) reported several
species from the Lake, making several new combinations. There were many taxa reported from several
species, both following the taxonomic traditions of the day to describe more varieties and forms than is
common today, and indicating the diversity of similar, but slightly different morphotypes present in the Lake.
In addition to the reports of Gomphoneis in Lake Baikal by Skvortzow & Meyer, and Skvortzow,
Skabitchevsky (1984, 1985, 1987) described new taxa of gomphonemoid diatoms that appear to have
affinities with Gomphoneis species, including the presence of multiple stigmoids around the central area.
Kociolek & Stoermer (1988b) attempted to determine the species of multiple stigmoid forms in the lake. They
used historical collections of √òstrup and Skvortzow to make preliminary observations on the taxa referred to
as Gomphoneis quadripunctata (√òstrup) P.A. Dawson ex R. Ross & P.A. Sims (1978: 162) and its allies.
Though Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1991) considered these as Gomphonema species, they are clearly
aligned to Gomphoneis as typified by G. elegans. In all, over 19 Gomphoneis taxa have been reported from
Lake Baikal, of which 12 were described from this locality (Table 1).

There has recently been increased interest in the diatoms of Lake Baikal, including a Darwin Initiative
(Flower et al. 2004, Flower 2005) project that yielded many samples from the lake, and the recovery of slides
of Skabitchevsky and Skvortzow (in the California Academy of Sciences and the Friedrich Hustedt Diatom
Study Center collection). The first two authors of this publication have also made collections from Lake
Baikal within the last 10 years. The recent publications on the pennate diatoms of Lake Baikal (Genkal et al.
2008, Kulikovskiy et al. 2011, 2012a,b,c, 2013) have yielded over 200 new species and 11 new genera.

The objective of the present report is to document and describe the diversity of members of the diatom
genus Gomphoneis in Lake Baikal, based on historical and more recent collections.

Materials and methods
Material includes original samples from Skabtichevsky collected from Bolshoi Ushkaniy Island in 1965;
samples from the expeditions of the UK Darwin Initiative (Flower 1995; collections made in 1997 and 1998);
further collections made by Kulikovskiy in 2011 (material kept in IBIW: collection Maxim Kulikovskiy, I.D.
Papanin Institute for Biology of Inland Waters, Russian Academy of Sciences, Russia) and by the senior
author in 1998 (material kept in COLO: University of Colorado Museum of Natural History, Boulder,
Colorado, USA). Samples consulted for this work are listed in Table 2. Type material is housed in IBIW,
COLO and SZCZ (collection Andrzej Witkowski, Institute of Marine Sciences, University of Szczecin).
Samples were cleaned with nitric acid, alternately rinsed and settled unto neutral. Cleaned material was
air-dried onto coverslips. For LM, air-dried material was mounted in Naphrax and observed with an Olympus
BX-51 microscope with 60X (1.42 N.A.) and 100X (1.40 N.A.) objectives with DIC. For SEM, the material
was attached to aluminum stubs, sputter-coated with gold-palladium and viewed with a JEOL field emission
SEM housed at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
Terminology for valve features of this group follows that of Kociolek & Stoermer (1989, 1993).

Valves clavate, with headpole broadly rounded, footpole rounded. Length 27‚Äì62 ¬µm, breadth 10‚Äì14 ¬µm.
Axial area straight, forming an orbicular central area that does not extend to the margin. Raphe lateral, with
distinctly dilated external proximal raphe ends. External distal raphe ends extend nearly straight from the
valve face to mantle, bisecting the distinct apical pore fields at footpole. Central area with 4‚Äì7 isolated
stigmoids around the central area. Striae costate, individual areolae not visible with LM. Striae strongly
radiate about the center of the valve, becoming parallel at both poles. Striae 13‚Äì15 in 10 ¬µm. Prominent septa
and pseudosepta at both poles.
In the SEM, the interior of G. hastata is dominated by the round central area (Figs 376, 377). The central
nodule is raised internally, and the elevated raphe terminates on the central nodule with proximal raphe ends
that are recurved in the same direction (Fig. 377). Around the base of the central nodule is located 4 isolated
stigmoids. The stigmoids are occluded with siliceous coverings, around the base of each are small pores (Fig.
377). Septa are associated with girdle bands at the poles (Fig. 376). Externally, the central area has the
stigmoids that occur in small, round depressions (Fig. 378). Proximal raphe ends are elongated and dilated
(Fig. 378). The doubly-punctate striae extend from the mantle to the valve face, terminating next to the axial
area with 1 or 2 areolae (Figs. 378). Valvocopula has a single row of pores (Fig. 379).
Observations:‚ÄîThe orbicular shape of the central area, not extending to the margin and the costate
nature of the striae help to distinguish this species from other, similar species in the genus.
Gomphoneis parahastata Kulikovskiy & Kociolek, sp. nov. (Figs 12‚Äì31, 380‚Äì381)
Valves lanceolate-clavate with headpole broadly rounded, footpole rounded. Length 32‚Äì78 ¬µm, breadth 12‚Äì17
¬µm. Axial area straight, narrow, expanded by irregularly long and short striae about the center to form an
irregular somewhat circular central area with 4 stigmoids that appear to be offset from one another. Raphe is
lateral with external proximal raphe ends dilated and distal ends nearly straight and extending onto the mantle
at both apices. Striae composed of two rows of areolae, resolvable with LM. Striae radiate, nearly parallel near
the headpole. Striae 12‚Äì14/ 10 ¬µm. Septa and pseudosepta present at poles. Apical pore field distinct composed
of stria-like rows or porelli. In the SEM the valve exterior has dilated proximal raphe ends and isolated
stigmoids in depressions in the irregularly rounded central area (Figs 380, 381). The striae are composed of
two rows of areolae (Figs 380, 381), and the apical pore fields appear as compressed striae (Fig. 381).
Type:‚ÄîRUSSIA: Bolshoi Ushkaniy Island, Lake Baikal (IBIW, slide no. 15651m!, in collection Maxim
Kulikovskiy, 20.07.1965, leg. A.P. Skabitschewsky, holotype here designated (= Fig. 15); COLO slide no.
15651p; SZCZ slide no. 15651¬∞, isotypes).
Gomphoneis lata (Skabitchevsky) Kociolek & Kulikovskiy, comb. nov. (Figs 32‚Äì39, 368‚Äì375)
Basionym: Gomphonema latum Skabitchevsky (1987: 74, pl. 2, figs 1‚Äì6).
Valves linear-lanceolate clavate with apices broadly rounded. Length 41‚Äì61 ¬µm, breadth 11‚Äì15 ¬µm. Axial
area narrow, straight, expanded to form a distinct, rectangular central area bordered by 2‚Äì3 shortened striae on
either side, with 4‚Äì9 isolated stigmoids. Raphe lateral, straight, with external proximal ends dilated and
rounded. External distal raphe ends deflected onto the mantle at the headpole, bisecting the apical pore field at
the footpole. Striae composed of two rows of fine areolae. Striae radiate at the center, nearly radiate to barely
parallel at poles. Striae 9‚Äì11/10 ¬µm. Apical pre fields composed of distinct rows of porelli. Septa and
pseudosepta present at the apices.
In the SEM, the external portion of the valve is dominated by thickened, distinct interstriae that alternate
with the striae (Figs 368‚Äì371). The axial area, interstriae and central area appear to be elevated from the level
of the areolae. Striae are composed on 2, sometimes 3 rows of areolae (Figs 369, 371). At the central area the
stigmoids are round and appear to occur in slightly sunken depressions (Fig. 370). The poles have the distal
raphe ends bent onto the mantle (Figs 369, 371), while at the footpole the apical pore fields appear as
compressed striae (Fig. 371). Internally, an overall view shows the presence of septa at both poles (Figs 372,

374). The internally elevated, elliptical central nodule bears the proximal raphe ends (Figs 372, 373, 375). The
proximal raphe ends are recurved in the same direction. Around the base of the central nodule there 4 isolated
stigmoids (Figs 373, 375). The stigmoidal openings appear slit like and occluded by teeth-like projections
(Figs 373, 375). Girlde bands have one row of rectangular openings (Figs 372, 374, 375).

Gomphoneis hastatoides Kociolek & Kulikovskiy, sp. nov. (Figs 40‚Äì60)
Valves distinctly clavate with broadest portion of the valve located past the central nodule towards the
footpole, with headpole broadly rounded and footpole rounded. Length 30‚Äì65 ¬µm, breadth 12‚Äì17 ¬µm. Axial
area straight, expanded to form a distinctly orbicular central area. Raphe lateral, straight, with external
proximal raphe ends dilated. Internal distal raphe ends distinct. External distal raphe ends nearly straight,
extending onto the valve mantle. Central area with 4 (rarely 5) isolated stigmoids. At the footpole the raphe
bisects the distinct apical pore fields that resemble the striae. Striae costate, individual areolae cannot be
resolved with LM. Striae radiate about the center of the valve and towards the footpole, becoming parallel
near the headpole. Striae 12‚Äì14/10 ¬µm. Septa and pseudosepta present at both poles.
Type:‚ÄîRUSSIA: Bolshoi Ushkaniy Island (rock), Lake Baikal, 16.07.2011, leg. M. Kulikovskiy (IBIW,
slide no. 18575m!, holotype here designated (= Fig. 41); COLO slide 18575p, isotype).
Observations:‚ÄîThis species is distinguished from G. hastata by the shape of the valves, with G.
hastatoides being broadest towards the footpole.
Gomphoneis eriensioides Kulikovskiy, Kociolek & Solak, sp. nov. (Figs 61‚Äì84, 397‚Äì400)
Valves lanceolate-clavate, with apices rounded. Length 26.0‚Äì67.5 ¬µm, breadth 8.5‚Äì13.0 ¬µm. Axial area
straight, expanded to form an irregularly rounded central area, with 3‚Äì5 shortened striae on either side. 4
stigmoids present around the central area. Raphe lateral, more or less straight with external proximal ends
dilated and round. External distal raphe ends extend straight onto the valve mantle. Costate striae strongly
radiate, except near the headpole where they approach being parallel. Striae 11‚Äì14/10 ¬µm. Apical pore fields
evident, comprised of distinct rows of porelli. Septa and pseudosepta present at the poles.
In the SEM the valve exterior has evident striae composed of two rows of areolae (Figs 397‚Äì399). The
stigmoidal openings around the central area appear to be in small, round depressions (Figs 397, 398).
Proximal raphe ends dilated (Figs 397, 398). Apical pore field porelli are organized into double rows, and
appear like condensed striae (Fig. 399). Internally, there are pseudosepta and helictoglossae at the poles. The
smallish central nodule has recurved proximal raphe ends at its margin, and there are 4 isolated stigmoids
around the base. Stigmoids may be unoccluded, or have small teeth-like projects (Fig. 400).
Type:‚ÄîRUSSIA: Bolshoi Ushkaniy Island (rock), Lake Baikal, N52o35.694, E107 o17.141, white stone
cape, on stone, 16.07.2011, leg. M. Kulikovskiy (IBIW slide no. 18575m, holotype designated here ( = Fig.
63); COLO slide no. 18575p, SZCZ slide no. 18575¬∞, isotypes).
Etymology:‚ÄîGomphoneis eriensioides is named for its superficial resemblance to G. eriense.
Observations:‚ÄîGomphoneis eriensioides differs from G. eriense by having 4 stigmoids rather than a
single stigma, undifferentiated apical pore fields rather than those composed of differentiated porelli, and lack
of longitudinal lines on either side of the axial area as seen in G. eriense (Patrick & Reimer 1975; Kociolek &
Stoermer 1988).
Gomphoneis cf. eriensioides Kulikovskiy, Kociolek & Solak (Figs 85‚Äì88, 401)
In the SEM this taxon has an undulate raphe and dilated proximal raphe ends externally. The stigmoid
openings are round and occur in depressions. The striae are composed of round, unoccluded areolae (Fig.
401).
Observations:‚ÄîValves given this designation are slightly more linear and narrow than G. eriensioides.
The outline of the valve appears somewhat irregular. We continue to look for smaller specimens that match
better with these valves. We wait finding a better size diminution series for this group before we decide to
describe it as a separate species.

Discussion
We record here a total number of 31 Gomphoneis taxa from Lake Baikal, 23 of these are new to science and 3
have been reported previously, and we also show possible species that are closely related to some of the new
species described herein. Two species we did not record in this survey include G. quadripunctata and G.
grandicaptata (see below), and both of these were previously reported from the lake (Kociolek & Stoermer
1988b; Skabitchevsky 1984). Inclusion of these two taxa makes the total number of Gomphoneis in Lake
Baikal to be 33. It is by far the largest number of taxa of the genus in any one area of the world, let alone in one
lake. Most of the species in Baikal, 26 of the 33 total (or nearly 80%), are of the stigmoid group, while the
remainder of the species are astigmate, all of the taxa within the Elegans subgroup. We have not encountered
any representatives in Baikal of the Herculeana subgroup of the genus, though they have been previously
reported (Meyer 1930). These previous reports, of G. ‚Äúherculeanum‚Äù from Lake Baikal are probably examples
of Gomphonema firma Skvortzow (1937: 353). Lakes Ohrid and Prespa have a large number (10) of
Gomphoneis taxa (even though some of them were described as Gomphonema, see below), and most of them
are astigmate. Half of the Gomphoneis taxa from these lakes are endemics (Levkov et al. 2007, Levkov &
Williams, 2011). Eight species of Gomphoneis were reported from Mongolia, but 7 of them were not identified
(only as ‚ÄúGomphonema spec.‚Äù Metzeltin et al. 2009, plate 171), and 8 new astigmate taxa have been described
from NW China, in Xinjiang Province (You et al. 2013). This arc between Lakes Ohrid and Prespa, through
China, Mongolia and Baikal, and the species present along this arc, is worthy of further study to see if there is a
pattern of evolutionary relationships between the taxa and the regions they inhabit. Kociolek and Stoermer
(1989, 1993) suggested that, unlike the astigmate group which may have its origins in Lakes Ohrid and Prespa,
where Gomphoneis transylvanicum (Pantocsek) Krammer in Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1985: 41) or taxa
similar to it is at or near the base of the lineage, the most primitive members of the stigmoid-bearing lineage are

from western North America, including G. elegans. Hence, it might be that Gomphoneis flora of Lake Baikal
has two different origins, astigmate taxa from the West and taxa with multiple stigmoids from the East.
Surprisingly, a small percentage of the Gomphoneis taxa identified previously from Lake Baikal are the
same as those we identified in our samples. Table 1 lists the taxa referred to Gomphoneis in past reports, and of
these 19 taxa, none of those referred to G. elegans (Kociolek & Stoermer 1986) G. eriense or G. herculeana
(Kociolek & Stoermer 1988a) were encountered. These species groups account for more than 60% (12 of the
19) of the Gomphoneis taxa reported. Some of these records, such as G. herculeana, G. eriense and G.
baicalensis Skvortzow & Meyer (1928: 29) were illustrated (Skvortzow & Meyer 1928 with a single stigma,
representing a lineage of Gomphoneis (the Herculeana group) that is not present in Lake Baikal. We expect
these are taxa that should be referred to the genus Gomphonema. Of the taxa listed in Table 1, we did record G.
hastata, and G. tumida and from Lake Baikal, a mere 10% of the total previously reported.
The level of endemism of Gomphoneis in Lake Baikal is high. Over 93% (31 of the total 33 taxa) of the
species and possible species we found in Lake Baikal have only been seen from this lake. The only two that
have been reported elsewhere are G. quadripunctata and G. tumida (Tuji 2005). While much of Siberia and
adjoining areas are still to be explored, and there are closely related species present in the area (Reichardt
2009), we expect that many of the species we have described here will be limited to the Lake. Levels of
endemism of Gomphoneis species in Lake Ohrid are 50%, and in western North America (where the
representatives are from the Herculeana subgroup), the levels are comparable. Kociolek (2012) lists 14
members of the genus from the USA, of which 9 (nearly 65%) are restricted to the western USA. Other taxa
considered by Kociolek & Stoermer (1988a), but not addressed in the USA on-line flora, would raise that
percentage.
In other groups of organisms in Lake Baikal with exceptional levels of endemism, the prevailing model of
evolution in the lake has been one of one or a few introductions followed by relatively fast divergence or intralacustrine speciation or radiation (Fryer 1991; Martens & Sch√∂n 1999), resulting in species flocks. Such data
has come from morphological observations, and more recently from molecular data. For example, molecular
support for the idea of a single monophyletic clade of cottoid fishes that rapidly diversified has been offered
by Kontula et al. (2003), while MacDonald et al. (2005) showed a similar set of relationships for amphipods
in Lake Baikal. Molecular data from isopods, however, suggests two separate invasions, to explain the six
endemic species found there (Hidding et al. 2003). Given the possibility of separate origins for the stigmoidbearing (source being western North America) and astigmate groups (source being Lake Ohrid) in Baikal,
based on the biogeographic implications of the phylogenetic analysis of the genus by Kociolek and Stoermer
(1989, 1993), it might appear that each of these introductions could have been followed by radiations within
Lake Baikal.
We have noted that Gomphoneis species we have encountered were usually found in either the central or
southern basins of the Lake. For example, a large group of species (e.g. G. eriensioides sp. nov., G. potapovae
sp. nov., G. strelnikovae sp. nov., G. inconspicua sp. nov., G. skabitchevskii sp. nov.) were found in the southern
basin only, while another set of species were found only in the central basin of the Lake, near the Ushkani
Islands (e.g. G. tumida, G. russica sp. nov., G. subrussica sp. nov., G. fourtanierae sp. nov., G. baicaliana sp.
nov.). Only a few species (G. parahastata sp. nov.) were found in both basins. Dorogostaisky (1923) described
a similar phenomenon for amphipods in Lake Baikal. Further research will be necessary to explore whether
the physical separation of species into difference basins reflects evolutionary descent. While amphipods
(Dorogostaisky 1923) and fish (Kontula et al. 2003) have apparently been able to exploit different habitats,
including different basins of the lake as well as the different depth regimes, it is not known how diatoms,
especially those whose growth habit is normally attached to substrates by mucilaginous stalks, can accomplish
this feat.
Documentation of stigmoid-bearing and astigmate members of the genus from several localities around
the world, suggests several of these species need nomenclatural transfers to the genus. We affect those
transfers here:

In addition to recognizing two groups within the Elegans lineage of Gomphoneis, namely those with 4 (or
more) stigmoids and those where stigmoids or stigma is wanting, we can also observe features shared across
the two groups. In every one of the Gomphoneis species we observed in Lake Baikal, features shared include
doubly-punctate striae, apical pore fields at the footpole that are undifferentiated, presence of septa and
pseudosepta, and a central nodule bearing proximal raphe ends recurved in the same direction.
There were several taxa and features that were variable across members of the genus. For example G. lata
has robust interstriae and in some specimens or on certain portions of the valve (apices), striae were composed
of both 2 and 3 rows of areolae. Gomphoneis lata and G. tumida (see figures 383‚Äì387) both exhibited
stigmoids with teeth-like projections internally, and that feature is also present in G. marvanii (Reichardt
2009, figure 82).
Gomphoneis hastata and its allies, as well as G. eriensioides (figures 398, 401), have external stigma
openings that occur in small depressions on the valve face. Internally, the stigmoids are occluded, and there
are small openings around the stigma. Also, relative to the stigmoids, G. capitata showed 4 isolated stigmoids
externally, but only two stigma openings internally (Figs 392‚Äì395). Internal stigma openings are not occluded
in G. capitata sp. nov., and this feature is also seen in G. inconspicua sp. nov. (Fig. 409), G. skabitchevskii sp.
nov. (Fig. 410) and G. cf. subcapitata (Fig. 406).
Position of the apical pore field in most Gomphoneis taxa is both on the valve face and valve mantle. This
is known in both major groups within the genus, and across many taxa in the Elegans subgroup (Kociolek &
Stoermer 1986, 1988b; Levkov et al. 2007; Tuji 2005; You et al. 2013). There were two taxa in Lake Baikal,
however, where the apical pore fields were structured differently. In G. potapovae sp. nov. (Figs 417, 418), and
G. strelinkovae sp. nov. (Fig. 412, 413), the apical pore field does not extend onto the valve face, but rather is
restricted to the valve mantle; this is also seen in G. sp. cf. reichardtii (Fig. 421).
This variation in the valve structure in stigmoid or astigmoid groups of Gomphoneis has not been
recognized previously. Further assessment of these features in recently described, or historically known taxa,
may help to further resolve evolutionary relationships of the Gomphoneis taxa within and outside of Lake
Baikal. Such a detailed understanding of the relationships of these taxa may yield an understanding of the
distributions across the lake and the arc eastward from the Balkans to eastern Asia through NW China,
Mongolia, Lake Baikal and the Russian Far East to Japan, and westward from North America.

PLATE 15: SEM. Gomphoneis eriensioides Fig. 397: External valve view, showing 5 isolated stigmoids in the central area, rounded
and dilated proximal raphe ends and the distal raphe ends deflected onto the mantle at both the headpole and footpole. Figs 398, 399:
External valve view showing dilated proximal raphe ends and stigmoids in round, sunken depressions. Fig 399: External view of
apical pore field, with porelli appearing as condensed striae. Fig. 400: Internal valve view showing small pseudosepta and
helictoglossae at poles, a small central nodule with proximal raphe ends recurved in the same direction and bordered by isolated
stigmoids. One stigmoid opening has teeth-like projections. G. cf. eriensioides. Fig. 401: External valve view showing undulate raphe
branches, dilated proximal raphe ends and stigmoidal openings in round depressions. G. fourtanierae. Figs 402‚Äì404: Internal views.
Figs 402‚Äì403 entire valve views. Both figures show the recurved proximal raphe ends, prominent helictoglossa and pseudosepta at the
poles. Fig. 404: Footpole with helictoglossa and narrow pseudoseptum evident. Siliceous bars are present at the apical pore fields,
similar to interstriae.

PLATE 16: SEM. Gomphoneis sp. cf. subcapitata. Fig. 405: External valve view showing outline of the valve, the close and slightly
dilated proximal raphe ends and stigmoids that are offset from one another. G. cf. subcapitata. Fig. 406: Internal valve view showing
relatively large helictoglossae at the poles. The central nodule is ellipsoidal, and has around its base 4 isolated stigmoids. Recurved
proximal raphe ends terminate on the central nodule. Small pseudosepta are present at the poles. G. subcapitata. Fig. 407: Internal
valve view shows broader interstriae, helictoglossae and pseudosepta. G. inconspicua. Figs 408‚Äì409: Fig. 408: External valve view.
Striae composed of double rows of areolae, terminating at the axial area in single areolae are separated by relatively wide interstriae.
Proximal raphe ends are dilated, and isolated stigmoids are indistinct. Fig. 409: Internal view showing simple stigmoid openings,
proximal raphe ends with recurved in the same direction, a helictoglossa offset from the raphe branch, and a very narrow
pseudoseptum at the footpole. G. skabitchevskii. Fig. 410: Internal valve view shows raphe with helictoglossae at the poles and
proximal ends recurved on the central nodule. Four stigmoids, with simple openings, are positioned around the base of the internally
raised central nodule. Fig. 411: External valve view shows the double rows of round areolae, many of them terminating near the axial
area in a single areola. The raphe is slightly undulate and has dilated proximal ends. The isolated stigmoids are barely differentiated
from the areolae, and two of the stigmoids look larger than the other two. Porelli of the apical pore field look similar to the areolae,
extending onto the mantle.

PLATE 17: SEM. Gomphoneis strelnikovae. Figs 412‚Äì416: Figs 412, 413: External valve views showing the raph brach with dilated
proximal raphe ends. Even though the striae around the central area terminate with a single areolae, there are not stigmoids internally.
The apical pore field is positioned entirely on the valve mantle, porelli do not extend onto the valve face. Figs 414‚Äì416: Internal
views. The central nodule is not well distinguished from the rest of the central area, and bears the proximal raphe ends that recurved in
the same direction. Helictoglossae and pseudosepta are present at the poles. G. potapovae. Figs 417‚Äì419: Figs 417‚Äì418: External
valve views showing straight raphe with slightly dilated proximal ends. The doubly punctate striae end in single areolae; those around
the central area appear larger than others. Porelli are located on the valve mantle. Fig. 4192: Internal valve view with septa evident at
the poles, along with helictoglossae. The central nodule is raised internally, and bears the proximal raphe ends recurved in the same
direction. G. sp. cf. reichardtii. Figs 420‚Äì421: Fig. 420: Internal valve view with 4 isolated stigmoids evident. Their openings are
simple. The central nodule is small, and bears recurved proximal raphe ends. The poles have helictoglossae and pseudosepta. Fig. 421:
