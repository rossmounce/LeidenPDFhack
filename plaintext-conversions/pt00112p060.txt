Abstract
The paleotropical monocot Pandanaceae family comprises c. 700 species distributed into five genera: Benstonea (c. 60
spp.), Freycinetia (c. 250 spp.), Martellidendron (6 spp.), Pandanus (c. 450 spp.) and Sararanga (2 spp.). Benstonea was
circumscribed to include species previously placed in Pandanus section Acrostigma (one of the four sections of
Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma). New phylogenetic data show that the six species of the remaining three sections of
subgenus Acrostigma (sections Epiphytica, Fusiforma and Platystigma) and a seventh species doubtfully placed in
section Acrostigma (Pandanus microglottis) also belonged to Benstonea. This genus is therefore characterized by a suite
of morphological characters, viz. stigmatic groove on the adaxial side of the stigma and a staminate flower reduced to 1
to 3 free stamens (sometimes joined at base). We therefore make here the necessary seven new combinations
accompanied by one lectotypification in Benstonea, a genus that now reflects the view of the visionary Benjamin Stone
who had already grouped these species in Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma based solely on morphology.

Introduction
The arborescent or lianoid dioecious monocot family Pandanaceae has c. 700 species distributed throughout
the paleotropics. Five genera have been recognized within the family: Benstonea Callmander & Buerki (in
Callmander et al. 2012: 328) (c. 60 spp.), Freycinetia Gaudichaud (1824: 509) (c. 250 spp.), Martellidendron
(Pichi-Sermolli in Martelli & Pichi-Sermolli 1951: 20) Callmander & Chassot (in Callmander et al. 2003) (6
spp.), Pandanus Parkinson (1773: 76) (c. 450 spp.) and Sararanga Hemsley (1894: 216) (2 spp.). The
systematics of this family has puzzled generations of botanists due to the apparent convergence/homology of
key morphological characters (especially in its largest genus Pandanus, see Buerki et al. 2012). A recent
molecular analysis based on plastid data greatly contributed to our understanding of the evolution of this
family and provided evidence to i) support new generic circumscriptions and ii) assess the infra-generic
classification within Pandanus (Buerki et al. 2012). One of the main results of this study was to show the
paraphyly of Pandanus: the species of Pandanus section Acrostigma Kurz (1867: 100) formed a distinct
lineage, now described as the genus Benstonea (Buerki et al. 2012, Callmander et al. 2012). Only species from
Pandanus section. Acrostigma were included in Benstonea (except P. microglottis Stone (1982: 34), doubtful
sectional placement; see Stone, 1982, 1993) since only species belonging to this section were included in the
phylogenetic inference. Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma (Kurz) Stone (1974: 521) included three other
sections: Epiphytica Martelli (1904: 304), Fusiforma St. John (in Holttum & St. John 1962: 227) and
Pseudoacrostigma Stone (1971: 146) in Stone’s (1974, 1978, 1983) classification. This subgenus was based
on the constant adaxial disposition of the stigmatic groove on the apex of each drupe and stamens solitary or in
triads (where in triads, free or very slightly joined at the base). Callmander et al. (2012) did not transfer all four

sections to Benstonea due to the high morphological heterogeneity of Pandanaceae and the frequent
convergence of key characters. In this context, the new genus was characterised by a very distinctive sharp
spiniform style with an adaxial disposition of the stigma groove. The three other sections possess blunter
(Pandanus section Fusiforma) to flat elliptic-ovate stigmas (Pandanus section Epiphytica and section
Pseudoacrostigma), but all with stigmatic grooves also placed on the adaxial side of the style.
Thanks to collaboration and recent fieldwork in Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo, the authors have been
able to include the species belonging to the three sections of Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma missing from
their previous molecular dataset (Booth et al. unpubl. data) and have confirmed that they resolve with the
other species of Benstonea. This new finding was obtained by including at least one representative of each
species in our previous plastid DNA matrix based on matK, trnQ-rps16 and trnL-trnF (Buerki et al. 2012). To
further improve our understanding of phylogenetic relationships between species of Benstonea, two additional
plastid regions were sequenced (ndhF-rpl32, trnV-ndhC). Finally, a Bayesian phylogenetic inference was
conducted following the approach described in Buerki et al. (2012) that strongly supported (with Bayesian
posterior probabilities > 0.95) the placement of these species in Benstonea (Booth et al. unpubl. data). The
newly sampled species are Pandanus microglottis B.C. Stone doubtfully placed in Pandanus section
Acrostigma (see Stone 1982, 1993), Pandanus epiphyticus Martelli (1904: 304), the sole member of Pandanus
section Epiphytica; P. platystigma Martelli (1904: 300), a member of Pandanus section Pseudoacrostigma
and P. dumetorum Holttum & St. John (1962: 227), P. saint-johnii Stone (1968: 412) and P. sobolifer Stone
(1968: 415), all three members of Pandanus section Fusiforma.
Benjamin Stone worked extensively for more then three decades (1960-1993) on the screw-pine family
and remains a leading source for global understanding and reliable classification of the whole family. Our new
results are in agreement with Stone’s circumscription of Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma. He was certainly a
visionary in combining characters from both staminate and pistillate plants in his classification (Stone, 1974).
When sterile, Benstonea is characterized by its leaves with generally armed apical ventral pleats. This
character is also present in a few species of Pandanus, e.g. P. discostigma Martelli (1914: 427). The pistillate
plants are characterized by their monocarpellate drupes with the stigmatic grooves consistently placed on the
adaxial side of the stigma (never present in Pandanus). Finally, the staminate flowers of Benstonea are
reduced to one stamen, or stamens in triads, free or very slightly joined at the base, a rare combination in
Pandanus. A clear trend towards filament connation and fasciation of stamens can be observed throughout the
latter genus with species showing an androecium represented by numerous stamens arranged in phalanges,
often with a stemonophore (nearly all the species) but some species have flowers reduced to a single stamen
attached to the axis (rarely, i.e. P. discostigma).
We here transfer the seven remaining species previously placed in Pandanus subgenus Acrostigma by
Stone (1974, 1978, 1982) to Benstonea. These species were previously placed in Pandanus section
Acrostigma (1 sp.), Pandanus section Epiphytica (1 sp.), Pandanus section Fusiforma (3 spp.) and Pandanus
section Pseudoacrostigma (2 spp.). Based on the findings mentioned above, we therefore propose the
following new combinations: Benstonea dumetorum (Holttum & H. St. John) Callm. & Buerki, comb. nov., B.
epiphytica (Martelli) Callm. & Buerki comb. nov., B. microglottis (B.C. Stone) Callm. & Buerki comb. nov.,

comb. nov., B. saint-johnii (B.C. Stone) Callm. & Buerki comb. nov. and B. sobolifer (B.C. Stone) Callm. &
Buerki, comb. nov. A lectotypification is also provided for B. platystigma where the most mature specimen is
designated as lectotype (Beccari 2050).
