In a review of the literature, including a recent taxonomic revision of Stephaniella and Stephaniellidium, previous
authors did not designate the nomenclatural types for three species of Stephaniella so that these names require
lectotypification.
In the following paragraphs, I propose lectotypes for Stephaniella boliviensis (Stephani 1916: 182), S.
paraphyllina (J.B. Jack 1894: 11) and S. sleumeri (K. Müller 1951: 177) based on materials received on loan from
B, G, M and S herbaria. In designating these lectotypes the characteristics of the specimens were checked against
the original description; the condition and size of the specimens were also considered for this purpose. The names
of the species are listed in alphabetical order.

Stephaniella boliviensis Steph., Bibliotheca Botanica 87: 182, 1916.
Type:—BOLIVIA. Catena Yanakaka, ca. 4600 m, Jul 1911, Th. Herzog 3750 (lectotype [here designated] M!, isolectotype G!,
B!).

Note:—Stephani (1916: 182), in the original description, cited two syntypes, Herzog 3750 and Herzog 4794. Váňa,
in 1995, considered 3750 and 4794 at G to be isolectotype and isosyntype, respectively, but this information was not
published (Váňa pers. comm.). Specimens of the remaining syntype, Th. Herzog 4794, were seen at G, M, and S.

Stephaniella paraphyllina J.B. Jack, Hedwigia 33: 11, 1894.
Type:—CORDILLERA ARGENTINO-BOLIVIANIS. Cienega, alpine region, 1873, P.G. Lorentz s.n. (lectotype [here
designated] G-00120479!, isolectotype G!, M!).

Note:—From Paul G. Lorentz’s collections of 1873, Jack (1894) described the genus Stephaniella with S.
paraphyllina as the type species. The type locality (Cienega in alpibus Argentino-Bolivianis, in solo glaresolutoso)
was cited, but no type specimens were mentioned.
Original material of Stephaniella paraphyllina (G00120478, G00120479, G00115491, G; M-0182810, M),
collected by Lorentz in 1873, was examined. Schmitt and Winkler (1968) considered the specimen at M to be a
syntype, but it is not clear if this specimen is part of the same or different gatherings because Lorentz did not
number his gatherings. Nonetheless, for nomenclatural purposes I conclude that all of the above original elements
are part of a single gathering. It should be noted that the moss collection at B, which likely contained Lorentz’s best
material, was destroyed (Stafleu & Cowan 1981: 157). At least one specimen in the Lorentz’s collection at G (G00115491) was likely examined by Jack as it was stamped with his herbarium name.

Stephaniella sleumeri Müll. Frib., Revue Bryologique et Lichénologique 20: 177, 1951.
Type:—ARGENTINA. Prov. Tucumán: Dep. Tafí, La Cienega, Morro de las Aguadas, ca. 2,800 m, 28 Jan 1950, H. Sleumer
s.n. (lectotype [here designated] S-B47665!, isolectotype B!, S!).

Note:—Müller (1951) only cited the type locality in the protologue, but did not cite a type specimen. Specimens
with the same collecting data as those given in the original description are deposited at B and S and I conclude that

these specimens represent a single gathering. No additional type information was provided when Stephaniellidium
sleumeri (Müll.Frib.) S. Winkl. ex Grolle, Acta Botanica Fennica 121: 38. 1983, was proposed.

Notes
Stephaniella hamata Steph., Bulletin de l’Herbier Boissier ser. 2, 1: 1024, 1901.
Type:—ARGENTINA. Córdoba, P.G. Lorentz s.n. (lectotype [Grolle in 1967, on herbarium label] G-00069943!).

Stephani (1901) cited specimens from Argentina and Brazil in the protologue, but did not designate a type. Grolle,
in 1967, designated Lorentz s.n. (G-00069943) as the lectotype on a label, but apparently did not publish his choice
(Váňa pers. comm.). Schmitt and Winkler (1968: 126) subsequently formally proposed the lectotype.

species of genus Stephaniella. CONACYT, Mexico, provided financial support for this research as part of Posgrado
