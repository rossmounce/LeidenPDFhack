Abstract
In 2008 two new species belonging to the genus Fryxelliella were described: F. sepulvedana and F. pacifica. They were
based on material collected in the Pacific Ocean and were both different from Fryxelliella floridana, the type species of
the genus. Examination of holotype and additional material for F. sepulvedana and F. pacifica was carried out.
Comparisons confirmed that F. sepulvedana and F. pacifica are both the same species. Only one valid name can be
assigned to any taxon and reasons are given to demonstrate that the valid name should be Fryxelliella sepulvedana.
Key words: diatom, Fryxelliella, nomenclature, ocelli, Pacific Ocean, priority, synonymy

Introduction
The genus Fryxelliella A.K.S. Prasad, K. Riddle & Livingston (1997: 306) was erected by Prasad et al. (1997) for
two species of diatoms they considered similar to Eupodiscus Bailey (1851: 39). Until 2007 Fryxelliella was
monotypic as one of the two species, Fryxelliella inconspicua (Rattray) A.K.S. Prasad in A.K.S. Prasad, K. Riddle
& Livingston (1997: 309; basionym: Eupodiscus inconspicuus Rattray 1888: 911), had been removed to
Praetriceratium P.A. Sims (2001: 404). Subsequently, Prasad & Nienow (2008) provided an emended description
of Fryxelliella and in 2008 two further species were described from the Pacific Ocean, Salina Cruz coast in the
Gulf of Tehuantepec, Mexico: F. sepulvedana Meave, Zamudio & Fernandez (Meave et al. 2008: 179) and F.
pacifica Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis (Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis 2008: 150).
In Fryxelliella sepulvedana the position and size of the ocelli was noted as the most distinctive character that
differentiated it from Fryxelliella floridana A. K. S. Prasad (1997: 306), the type species of the genus. Other
characters, such as the structure of cribra, density of the sub-triangular apertures, and continuity of the sipho
marginalis were also mentioned (Meave et al. 2008). Fryxelliella pacifica was differentiated from F. floridana by
the size and shape of the cell, size location and morphology of ocelli, shape and density of the sub-triangular
marginal apertures and the external morphology of rimoportulae (Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis 2008).
These data justified the creation of a new species different from F. floridana but they describe one species not two.
As both F. sepulvedana and F. pacifica were published in the same year, neither set of authors was aware of the
duplication. This paper reviews the evidence and type material of both Fryxelliella sepulvedana and F. pacifica.

Material and methods
Type material of Fryxelliella sepulvedana and F. pacifica is present in MEXU (National Herbarium at Biology
Institute of Autonomous National University of Mexico).
Slides were observed using a compound microscope (Olympus BX50) in bright field and phase contrast with
integrated digital camera (light microscopy = LM). Photographs were obtained at 40x and 100x magnifications.
Measurements were made with a calibrated ocular at 10x, 40x and 100x in a compound microscope (Zeiss).

Material collected from Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, México in October 2006, was rinsed to remove salts
and fixatives and the specimens were then mounted for scanning electron microscope (SEM) using a JEOL JSM5900LV.
Comparisons of morphological characters and diagnostic features were made using data from the literature as
well as new observations on holotype and isotype specimens.
The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) was consulted for the
current rules of priority and effective and valid publication (McNeill et al. 2012; http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/
main.php) so as to establish the priority of either Fryxelliella sepulvedana or F. pacifica as the valid name.
Abbreviations used: Light microscopy (LM); scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Taxonomic results
Fryxelliella sepulvedana Meave, Zamudio & L. F. Fernandes (2008: 179)
Synonym: Fryxelliella pacifica Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis (2008: 150)
Type:—MEXICO: Salina Cruz coast in the Gulf of Tehuantepec, Pacific Ocean (MEXU 1837!, holotype of Fryxelliella
sepulvedana; MEXU 1838!, MEXU 1839!, MEXU 1840!, MEXU 1841!, isotypes of Fryxelliella sepulvedana; MEXU
1705!, holotype of Fryxelliella pacifica).

Diagnostic character: Valve with 3 large ocelli separated from valve margin by 3–6 areolae (Figs 1, 2, 4, 5, 8;
characters observed easily by LM).
General description (LM): Valves circular with diameter of 37–75 µm (Figs 1, 4, 7, 8). Central areolae larger
than elsewhere on valve; areolae radiate from centre of valve to margin. 3 ocelli with diameter of 2.5–5 µm (Figs 4,
8), separated from margin by 5–10 µm (or 3–6 areolae) (Figs 2, 5). Three rimoportulae adjacent to sipho
marginalis, each equally spaced between ocelli (Figs 4, 7). Sometimes 2 rimoportulae occur between ocelli (slide
MEXU 1840). Sipho marginalis visible as hyaline ring (Figs 2, 3, 5, 6, 8) with sub-triangular holes, density of 8–
11 in 10 µm (Figs 3, 6). Ocelli of epivalve coinciding with rimoportulae of hypovalve (Fig 7). All 6 ocelli
distinguishable in complete frustule in valve view (Fig. 7); frustules less broad in girdle view.
SEM: Details recorded in Meave et al. (2008) and Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis (2008). Careful
observations of the external structure of the rimoportulae indicate that these are single tubes without ornamentation
and with the base surrounded by granules (Figs 9, 10).

Discussion
Taxon characters: Comparison of the morphological characters for species of Fryxelliella shows that the characters
of F. sepulvedana and F. pacifica describe the same species. Examination of the two slides labeled for the holotypes
of F. sepulvedana (MEXU 1837) and F. pacifica (MEXU 1705) was limited to one valve per species.
Measurements made on these specimens confirmed the information provided in the original descriptions, although
for Fryxelliella pacifica (MEXU 1705) the diameter was larger than that of the figure indicated as iconotype: 47
µm for the specimen in figures 2 and 3 (Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis 2008); 75 µm for the actual holotype
specimen on MEXU 1705. Examination of material labeled as isotypes (MEXU 1838, MEXU 1839, MEXU 1840,
MEXU 1841) corresponded to the reported size ranges. It should be noted that these slides are not isotypes as they
are not duplicates of holotype (Art. 9.4, McNeill et al. 2012); these specimens are from different localities, one is
from the same locality but collected in a different year.
Observations made with SEM corroborate the characters previously described in Meave et al. (2008) and
Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis (2008). However, the rimoportula ornamentation described as a “crown”
structure (Hernández -Becerril & Barón-Campis 2008) was not observed in our specimens. This ornamentation
may not be constant and therefore not useful as a diagnostic character. Resolution by LM is sufficient to distinguish
the species from others.

Priority Considerations: According to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants
both Fryxelliella sepulvedana and Fryxelliella pacifica are validly published (Art. 32) but if the two are considered
synonyms, only one name can be applied, the correct name being that which was first published (Art. 11.4). As
both names appeared in 2008, some further publication facts are required.
Fryxelliella pacifica: the manuscript describing this species was received by the editor of Phycological
Research on 9th June, 2007 and was accepted on November 23rd, 2007 (Hernández-Becerril & Barón-Campis
2008); the manuscript was assigned a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) on 19th August 2008. Publication of that issue
of Phycological Research was September 2008, according to the date on the cover.
Fryxelliella sepulvedana: the manuscript describing this species was received by the editor on 28th November,
2007 and was accepted on January 10th, 2008 (Meave et al. 2008). Publication of that issue was after January but
before June 2008, according to the date on the cover (“Jan/Jun. 2008”); the journal editor has confirmed that the
publication date was June 2008 (pers. comm.).
Thus, Fryxelliella sepulvedana is considered to have been first published June 2008 and Fryxelliella pacifica
first published three months later in September 2008 (if the valid publication date is taken as that of the electronic
version, the DOI document was available on August 19th ): thus the correct name for this taxon is Fryxelliella
sepulvedana.
