Abstract
A putative natural hybrid between Cohniella ascendens and C. brachyphylla (Orchidaceae, Oncidiinae) from western
Costa Rica, C. ×francoi, is herein newly described, illustrated and characterized based upon both morphological and
anatomical characters. This taxon hybrid is most similar to C. ascendens but the flowers show intermediate characters
between the putative parents. Cohniella ×francoi is similar to C. ascendens in its semipendulous inflorescences, callus
shape, cylindrical column base with linear oblong wings, and obovate stigmatic cavity plus several anatomical
characters. On the other hand, it is similar to C. brachyphylla in the oblong to subquadrate lateral lobes of the labellum
that are in the same plane as the central lobe, and the rectangular disc of the labellum with a lateral extension of the callus
in the margins. A table of diagnostic characters for the new hybrid and its putative parents, a comparative figure, and a
map showing their geographical distributions are also provided.

Resumen
Cohniella ×francoi, un híbrido natural entre Cohniella ascendens y C. brachyphylla (Orchidaceae, Oncidiinae) del oeste
de Costa Rica es aquí descrito, ilustrado y caracterizado por caracteres morfológicos y anatómicos. El nuevo híbrido es
más similar a C. ascendens pero las flores presentan caracteres intermedios entre sus padres putativos. Cohniella
×francoi se parece a C. ascendens en la inflorescencia semipéndula, la forma del callo, la columna cilíndrica con las alas
linear oblongas y la cavidad estigmática obovada, además de varios caracteres anatómicos. Por otro lado, es similar a C.
brachyphylla por los lóbulos laterales del labelo oblongos a subcuadrados y extendidos en el mismo plano que el lóbulo
central y el disco rectangular con extensiones laterales del callo en los márgenes. Adicionalmente, proporcionamos una
tabla de caracteres diagnósticos para el nuevo híbrido y sus padres putativos, una figura comparativa y un mapa
detallando las distribuciones geográficas de los tres taxones.

Introduction
The genus Cohniella Pfitzer (1889: 194) is distinguished from others members of the Oncidiinae by the
relatively small and subspherical, 1-leaved pseudobulbs, succulent, terete leaves, and Oncidium-like flowers

(Carnevali et al. 2010). At the present, the genus includes 22 species and one natural hybrid (Cetzal-Ix et al.
2013). Most species in the genus show disjunct distributional patterns (e.g. C. leptotifolia Cetzal & Carnevali
(2010: 198), C. pendula Carnevali & Cetzal (in Carnevali et al. 2010: 171), C. lacera (Lindley 1844: 30)
Cetzal (2012a: 139), etc.). However, a few species share distributional ranges with one or more congeneric
taxa; these include C. ascendens (Lindley 1842: 4) Christenson (1999: 177), C. cepula (Hoffmannsegg 1843:
833) Carnevali & Romero (in Carnevali et al. 2010: 167), and C. nuda (Lindley 1837: 1994) Christenson
(1999: 177). In all cases of sympatry of parapatry, the species involved are not sister taxa. For example, C.
cebolleta (Jacquin 1760: 30) Christenson (1999: 177), a member of the C. cebolleta complex (Cetzal-Ix et al.
2013) is para- or sympatric with C. nuda, a member of the C. ascendens complex, whereas C. cepula (a
member of the C. cepula complex) occurs in the same habitats as C. jonesiana (Reichenbach 1883: 781)
Christenson (1999: 177), a member of the C. jonesiana complex (Cetzal-Ix et al. 2012b). No instances of
natural hybrids between these pairs of species are known to occur.
Cohniella ascendens is unique in the genus in that it overlaps its distributional range with three other
congeneric taxa, all members of the C. brachyphylla (Lindley 1842: 4) Cetzal & Carnevali (in Carnevali et al.
2010: 163) complex. Cohniella ascendens usually grows in evergreen to semi-evergreen forest but, more
rarely, it also occurs in semi-deciduous forest and several types of secondary vegetation at elevations of 0–500
(–900) m. Thus, in Mexico, along the Gulf drainage north of the Tehuantepec isthmus, this species is
sympatric with C. biorbicularis Balam & Cetzal (in Carnevali et al. 2010: 162). Also in Mexico, it is
sympatric or parapatric with C. yucatanensis Cetzal & Carnevali (2010: 206) in the northern Yucatan
Peninsula (Carnevali et al. 2010, Cetzal-Ix & Carnevali 2010) whereas it shares these habitats with C.
brachyphylla in western Chiapas through extreme NW Costa Rica, along the Pacific drainage of Central
America. The flowering period of these four species broadly overlap (Table 1), but so far no natural hybrids
have been recorded or described.

(+) Flowering. (*) Peak bloom.

As found in other genera in subtribe Oncidiinae (e.g. Oncidium Swartz (1800: 239), Lophiaris Rafinesque
(1838: 40), and many others) Cohniella species feature a generalized floral architecture resembling blooms of
the family Malpighiaceae, which are mainly pollinated by oil-gathering Centris bees (Dodson 1972,
Carmona-Díaz & García-Franco 2009). Therefore, it is possible that these insects are able to visit and
pollinate flowers of orchid species of the same or different genera, opening the possibility for intrageneric and
intergeneric hybridization to occur, of which several examples are known in the group of genera related to
Cohniella (e.g. Lophiaris ×haematochila (Lindley & Paxton (in Lindley 1850: 21)) Braem (1993: 19), L.
×oerstelurida Cetzal & Balam (2012: 139), and ×Cohnlophiaris quintanarooensis Cetzal & Carnevali (in
Cetzal-Ix et al. 2012a: 41)).
Despite all this, there is just a single natural intrageneric hybrid in Cohniella formally described. This is
Cohniella ×marvraganii (Lückel 1998: 90) Christenson (1999: 177), the natural cross of C. jonesiana and C.
stacyi (Garay 1973: 301) Christenson (1999: 177). This nothospecies was described from Santa Cruz, Bolivia,

and it is only known from two collections, each one morphologically more similar to one parent than to the
other. These two, otherwise closely related species, are very different, rendering the natural hybrid readily
identifiable by a combination of characters, some found in neither of the parents, others intermediate between
the two.
However, other sympatric species of Cohniella are not as obviously distinct and the possibility that other
events of natural hybridization may have been overlooked cannot be ruled out. To recognize other
nothospecies within the genus would require knowledge of the morphology (and its variation) and
biogeography of the putative parents.
Recently, in an area of tropical evergreen forest in the southern portion of the Guanacaste province (Santa
Rosa National Park), Costa Rica, a plant was collected with intermediate floral characteristics between those
of C. ascendens and C. brachyphylla. We here interpret this combination of morphological and anatomical
characters as evidence of a hybrid status for this plant, which is herein proposed as the new nothospecies,
Cohniella ×francoi Cetzal & Carnevali.

Material and methods
Plant material
All the specimens studied were prepared from plants collected in the field. Representative samples of each
taxon were deposited in the Herbarium CICY: Cohniella ascendens (Chiapas, Mexico, Cetzal 36), C.
brachyphylla (Chiapas, Mexico, Carnevali 7310), and the new hybrid (Carnevali 7257). Morphological
characters of the new natural hybrid and putative parents were revised under the dissecting microscope.
Additionally, we assessed morphological characters of additional putative parents from the taxonomic
revisions of Carnevali et al. (2010) and Cetzal-Ix & Carnevali (2010). Images of live flowers were obtained
with an Epson Expression 1640 XL scanner. Digital images of flowers were captured at several resolutions,
ranging from 600 to 1200 dpi. Digital line drawings were produced with Canvas, Version X Build 925, using
the digital images previously captured to provide outlines. A distributional map was produced by plotting the
locality data cited here and previous studies of Carnevali et al. (2010) and Cetzal-Ix & Carnevali (2010) on an
image data “shaded and colored SRTM elevation model” (NASA/JPL/NIMA 2002) using ArcView 3.2 (ESRI
1999).
Foliar anatomy
Samples of mature leaves for anatomical study from the same plants mentioned under “Plant Material”
above. Sections were taken from the middle portion of the leaf and fixed in FAA (5% formaldehyde, 5%
acetic acid, 40% water, and 50% ethanol) (Sass 1958). The sections were cut transversely freehand, stained
with 0.5% aqueous Toluidine blue, mounted in 50% glycerin, and sealed with clear nail polish. The slides are
included in the holotype specimen. For the study of leaf epidermis, 0.5 cm wide leaf sections were placed in
an approximately 3.75% sodium hypochlorite solution for three hours, washed with distilled water, cleaned of
mesophyll remnants with a brush, and stained and mounted in the same manner as the transverse sections.
Observations were made using a Leica-DME microscope, and pictures were taken with a Nikon Eclipse E 200
microscope equipped with a camera.

and in the rectangular disc of the labellum with a conical lateral extension on the margins. It is distinguished from
both parental taxa by the brown callus with white teeth as well as the combination of the Cohniella ascendens type
callus with a rectangular disc bearing conical lateral extensions on the margins.

mesophyll cells toward 2–6 cell apart from the epidermis. Vascular tissue system: comprised by closed,
collateral vascular bundles (Fig. 4B–C), arranged in two central, concentric series (Fig. 4A), made up of
bundles of a larger size and many of smaller dimensions which are scattered in the mesophyll.
Distribution and ecology:––Cohniella ×francoi is only known from the vicinity of the Santa Rosa
National Park in Guanacaste province, Costa Rica. This hybrid grows in tropical dry forest (Holdridge 1967)
where the distribution ranges of its putative parents, C. ascendens and C. brachyphylla, overlap (Fig. 2). The
Santa Rosa National Park and surrounding areas are located in the Santa Rosa Plateau at 300 m of elevation,
between the Pacific Coast and the Guanacaste Cordillera (Heinrich & Hurka 2004); in this area both putative

cebolleta (Jacquin 1760: 30) Swartz (1800: 240) and the C. ascendens parent as O. ascendens Lindley (1842:
4). Vouchers for these two species from the general Guanacaste area are cited in Cetzal-Ix & Carnevali (2010).

In most localities along their distributional range, both parental taxa are allopatric (Fig. 2, map scale is too
large in some areas to clearly show this). However, in a few known localities both species appear to be
parapatric, i.e. occurring in the same general area but growing in different vegetation types; Cohniella
ascendens always found growing in the more humid, shadier places. Thus, the two taxa can grow within
flying distance of a potential common pollinator. The occurrence of this natural hybrid between C. ascendens
and C. brachyphylla suggests that, where the existence of vegetation mosaics allow for the habitats of both
parental taxa to coexist within pollinator flying distance, gene exchange between these clearly different taxa
may occur. We know little about the pollinators of these two taxa. We have observed oil-gathering Centris
bees visiting C. brachyphylla both in the field as in cultivation (where the visits result in the successful
production of capsules), whereas have never seen any pollinator on C. ascendens. There is a report of Trigona
nigra Cresson as a pollinator of C. ascendens (Parra-Tabla et al. 2000) but the reported locality (Dzilam de
Bravo in northern Yucatan State, México) makes it highly unlikely that they were actually studying this
species (most likely it was C. yucatanensis). Since there are no plant vouchers reported in the Parra-Tabla et
al. (2000) study, we have to disregard the report at this time.

Cohniella ×francoi is further distinguished from C. ascendens and C. brachyphylla by the brown callus

Anatomical analysis:—Cohniella ×francoi has anatomical features intermediate between the putative
parents (Table 3). It is similar C. ascendens by the smooth cuticle, convex external periclinal walls of the
epidermal cells, the absence of striations in the stomatal guard cellls, the absence of starch in parenchyma
cells of mature plants, and the presence of druses in parenchyma cells; it is similar to C. brachyphylla in the
hexagonal epidermal cell shape. This combination of anatomical features renders this nothospecies most
similar to C. ascendens. Otherwise, the putative hybrid is characterized anatomically by tetracytic stomata,

reticulate wall thickening walls of the mesophyll cells, and the vascular bundles arranged in two central
arches. Cohniella species with smooth cuticle are usually found growing under more shady and humid
conditions than those with a papillose cuticle (Cetzal-Ix 2012b). This nothospecies also has two concentric
rings of vascular bundles in the mesophyll, a character found only in species of the C. ascendens complex
(albeit absent from C. ascendens itself), a group of species restricted to humid, shady environments (Cetzal-Ix
2012b).
