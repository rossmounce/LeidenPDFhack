Abstract
A new species of Hassallia (Cyanobacteria, Nostocales, Microchaetaceae) from a supralittoral tropical marine biotope is
described. Hassallia littoralis is a false-branched nostocalean cyanobacterium with caespitose free filaments or with
fasciculated individual filaments not in a common sheath. Filaments are mainly heteropolar, bearing mono- and bi-pored
heterocysts and isopolar or heteropolar hormogonia. The sheath is often widening, with pronounced rounded terminals.
This new species is defined according to molecular, morphological and ecological criteria, considering data from
different stages of its life cycle as well as the 16S rRNA partial gene sequence.

Introduction
In recent decades, many important revisions have occurred for Cyanobacteria, applying the polyphasic
approach that generated a modern classification system (Hoffmann et al. 2005). This strategy has led to major
advances in taxonomy and the phylogenetic cyanobacterial classification by combining the traditional
morphological characterization with the inclusion of molecular and ecological data from cultured, and
especially field material. This new approach has provided essential support for the modern classification
system of cyanobacteria (Komárek 2006). Key studies such as those of Flechtner et al. (2002), Gugger et al.
(2002), Iteman et al. (2002), Rajaniemi et al. (2005), and Komárek et al. (2012), among others, have
contributed to support the relevance of this approach, that has produced the description of numerous new taxa,
as well as species being transferred into different generic entities.
The family Microchaetaceae (Nostocales) has been under intensive revision, with several new species and
even genera being described, such as Spirirestris Flechtner & Johansen in Flechtner et al. (2002: 6), Rexia
Casamatta, Gomez & Johansen (2006: 23), Streptostemon Sant’Anna, Azevedo, Kastovský & Komárek (2010:
220), Ophiotrhix Sant’Anna, Azevedo, Kastovský & Komárek (2010: 218), Godleya Novis & Visnovsky
(2011: 14), Toxopsis Lamprinou & Pantazidou in Lamprinou et al. (2012: 2872), and Calochaete Hauer,
Bohunická & Mühlsteinová (2013: 38). Currently, the family Microchaetaceae contains 13 genera (Table 1).
Hassallia Berkeley ex Bornet & Flahault (1886–1888: 115), Coleodesmium Borzì ex Geitler (1942: 154)
and Tolypothrix Kützing ex Bornet & Flahault (1886–1888: 118) are genera that show some morphological
overlapping traits, and therefore have delimitation problems. Even Hassallia and Coleodesmium have not
been accepted in some identification manuals (Komárek et al. 2012), for instance Starmach (1966) included
several species of Hassallia within Tolypothrix, and similar criteria were used by Bourrelly (1969, 1970).
Similar morphotypes of Hassallia have been sometimes identified as members of genus Tolypothrix, such as

T. bouteillei (Brébisson & Desmazières ex Bornet & Flahault) Lemmermann (1910: 219), which was recently
included within genus Hassallia (Komárek et al. 2012) and has been recorded as the marine Hassallia
bouteillei Brébisson & Desmazières ex Bornet & Flahault (1886–1888: 116) by Bárbara et al. (2005). In
addition, populations of T. byssoidea (Berkeley) Kirchner in Engler & Prantl (1898: 80) are reported by
Whitton & Potts (1979) as endolithic and chasmolithic in the Aldabra supralittoral, these probably belong to
Hassallia byssoidea Hassall (1845: 233) in Bornet & Flahault (1888: 116).
The supralittoral zone is a distinctive extreme biotope from the intertidal zone to the limit of terrestrial
vegetation (Garbary 2007). This zone is inhabited by few organisms, and is considered to have one of the
toughest physical conditions (Ramírez-Reinat, 2010). Mexican marine cyanobacteria are poorly known, with
just a few studies describing populations of this group of organisms (León-Tejera & Montejano 2000, LópezCortés et al. 2001, Montejano & León-Tejera 2002, León-Tejera et al. 2003, 2005). Previous reports from the
supralittoral zone in Oaxaca coasts are few, reporting dark green-brown crusts or dark green filamentous mats.
For the supralittoral of the same region (San Agustín, Huatulco area), Scytonema cf. insulare Sant’Anna
(1988: 528), a heterocystous cyanobacteria, which grows over a crust of Kyrtuthrix cf. maculans (Gomont
1901: 210) Umezaki (1961: 85) and Cyanodermatium gonzalezii León-Tejera, Montejano & Cantoral-Uriza
(2003: 365) have been reported.
Marine species of Hassallia have not been recorded previously from Mexico; however, we have found
conspicuous growths of epilithic black mats of this genus as the dominant taxon in the rocky supralittoral zone
of Tangolunda bay (Tropical Pacific Mexico). The aim of this work is to describe a new species of Hassallia
from field material collected in a particular and extreme marine biotope, using a polyphasic approach that
combines a detailed morphological characterization of our populations as well as genotypic characteristics
determined by 16S rRNA analysis.
Materials and Methods
Site description and sample collection:—This study was conducted with material collected from a granitic
coastal cliff on the east side of Tangolunda bay (15° 46’ 24.79” N, 96° 5’ 28.32” W), within Huatulco
National Park, located in the Tropical Mexican Pacific (TMP). Climate is warm subhumid with summer rains
and low rainfall in winter, with an annual average temperature of 26.9 ˚C. This region has a torrential rainfall
regime with annual values from 800 to 1500 mm, concentrated from June to October. Seawater temperature
range is 20.5–34.4 ˚C, and salinity values 17.3–40.1 PSU, average 34.6 PSU (Granja & López-Pérez 2008).
Tidal regime is mixed, with semidiurnal dominance. The dominant swell comes from the West and a
component from the South during summer. 92.5% of the incident waves arrive with heights in the range of 0.3
to 2.4 m (highest values in summer, CONANP 2003). Three samples of conspicuous microbial mat growths,
found on nearly vertical rock walls 7 m above sea level, were collected in February 2011 with hammer and
chisel. Each sample was divided into two subsamples, one preserved dry and the other in 4% formaline in
seawater. Even though cultures have not been obtained, we have made an ecological, molecular and
morphological characterization to describe these populations.
Morphology:—For the morphological characterization of field populations, we have analysed
micrographs obtained with an Olympus DP12 digital camera in an Olympus CX51 microscope (DIC and light
field); epifluorescence micrographs were obtained with an Olympus Provis AX70 microscope. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained in a JEOL mod JEM 1010 microscope from live material
after fixation in 6% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M PBS and subsequent postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide,
dehydration in ethanol series and embedding in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were contrasted with acetate
uranil and lead citrate according to Reynolds (1963). Morphology measurements were obtained using
SigmaScan© automated image analysis software (Jandel Scientific, Sausalito, California) and expressed as
means ± standard deviation of 20–40 measurements. Morphological identification was done in accordance
with new and traditional reference works (Bornet & Flahault 1886–1888, Gardner 1927, Frémy 1930,
Flechtner et al. 2008, Komárek et al. 2012). Komárek & Hauer (2013) was used for the systematics.

Molecular analysis:—Total DNA was extracted from natural populations using the MoBio UltraClean
Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, California), according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Quality and quantity of extracted DNA were checked on a 1% agarose gel. The 16S rRNA gene
was partially amplified using the cyanobacteria specific primers proposed by Nübel et al. (1997) (106F,
CYA781R, CYA781F) and Neilan et al. (1997) (CYA359F, 1494Rc). PCR conditions used for the 16S rRNA
gene cyanobacterial amplification were as follows: 50 µl PCR reaction mix containing 1x reaction buffer, 1 µl
of each primer (36 µmol), 1 µl of a stock solution of dNTPs (10 mM dNTPs mixture) 5 µl of MgCl2 buffer (1
× 2.5 mM) and 1 µl of DNA polymerase (5U/µl) (Amplificasa, Biogénica, Mexico), as well as 1 µl of
genomic DNA (10 ng DNA). Cycling conditions had an initial denaturation step of 95 °C for 7 min, followed
by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 0.5 min, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, extension at 72 °C for 1
minute and final extension at 4 °C. PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. After amplification,
DNA was cleaned using the QIAquick® PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). Sequencing was conducted using a
BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, California) on an ABI PRISM3100
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, California). The same primers were used for sequencing.
Phylogenetic analysis:—Sequences were obtained for both DNA strands, assembled and corrected into
1307 bp fragments using Bioedit software version 7.0.9.0 (Hall 1999). Representative taxa from available
sequences of Microchaetaceae and Scytonemataceae taxa from GenBank were used as ingroups and
outgroups. Phylogenetic analysis was based on 20 sequences obtained from GenBank (>1100 bp fragments of
the 16S rRNA gene) except Hassallia byssoidea type species sequence (1057 bp). These sequences included
all those of the Hassallia species described up to date as well as sequences of representative genera of the
family Microchaetaceae (Microchaete, Fortiea, Tolypothrix, Spirirestris, Toxopsis, Calochaete and
Coleodesmium). Additionally, we added three sequences considered as outgroups, two belonging to
Brasilonema and one to Scytonema (family Scytonemataceae). All sequences were aligned using the
CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program (Thompson et al. 1994) and manually edited in
PhyDE® version 0.9971 (Müller et al. 2010). Phylogenetic relationships were inferred with Winclada (Nixon
1999–2002) and TOPALi v2 (Milne et al. 2009). Maximum parsimony (MP) trees were constructed using the
Ratchet search (Nixon 1999). The model used in the Bayesian analysis (B) was the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano
model of nucleotide substitutions with invariant sites and gamma distributed rates for the variable sites
(HKY+I+G). This model was selected based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) ratio test implemented by
TOPALi version 2 software with a significance level of 0.01. For the Bayesian analysis, we ran five chains of
the Markov chain Monte Carlo (one hot and four cold), sampling one tree every 1000 generations for 5·×106
generations starting with a random tree. ML and MP analyses were subjected to bootstrap resampling (1000
replicates with 10 random additions) to estimate robustness (Felsenstein 1985). The range of 16S ribosomal
RNA gene divergence values within and among species was calculated using uncorrected “p” distances using
PAUP* version 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002).

Etymology:—The species epithet was selected according to the specific environment (marine littoral).
Habitat:—In Tangolunda Bay, supralittoral black mats of Hassallia dominate this habitat and the three
collected populations were epilithic mats from the rocky marine littoral. They were found growing on nearly
vertical igneous rocks 7 m from the seaside and approximately 4–5 m above sea level, facing the sea. The
rocks are only slightly wetted by the sea breeze and totally exposed to sunlight. Considering the maximal tidal
heights of 2.4 m, probably they are never covered by the sea but grains of salt were found intermingled among
filaments due to the sea breeze water evaporation. This species was found growing with several undescribed

coccoid and LPP species (Fig. 1) but not with common filamentous non-heterocystous (Oscillatoria, Lyngbya,
Microcoleus, Phormidium, Schizothrix) or heterocystous genera (Rivularia, Calothrix, Scytonema) typically
described for intertidal biotopes (Brito et al. 2012).
Observations:—Cells appearing as monocytes and short hormogonia of 2 to 10 (15) cells long (Fig. 25),
are sometimes liberated. Young filaments and hormogonia are either isopolar (Figs. 6, 7, 24) or heteropolar
(Figs. 9, 22). Isopolar hormogonia formation through necridic cells (Fig. 23) develop later terminal/basal
heterocytes (Figs. 6, 7, 9, 17, 18, 22). Sheath becomes lighter or darker toward the extremes, probably due to
terminal gelatinization (Figs. 10, 14, 15). Populations morphologically characterized are C76 (PTM9586 and
UAMIZ1225), C77 (PTM9587) and C78 (PTM9588). The sequence was obtained from sample C76.
Molecular and phylogenetic analyses:—A total of 24 sequences of representative taxa from available
sequences of Microchaetaceae and Scytonemataceae deposited at GenBank were analyzed, including
Brasilonema bromeliae DQ486055, Scytonema sp. AB093483 and Brasilonema tolantongensis JN676147 as
outgroups and our strain. The three approaches used (MP, B and ML), produced similar clustering, therefore
only the ML tree, with support values of ML, B and MP is shown in Fig. 26. Topology of the ML tree showed
that the Hassallia assemblages including seven taxa are segregated into two clades supported by modest
bootstrap values. The earliest diverging clade included H. byssoidea. The second clade included two sister
groups: one defined by H. antarctica Komárek, Nedbalová et Hauer (2012: 770) assemblage, and the other by
H. littoralis, H. andreassenii Komárek, Nedbalová et Hauer (2012: 768) and Coleodesmium sp. ANT (Fig.
26). Hassallia littoralis is moderately supported by bootstrap values in ML and MP topologies, but with a
higher value in Bayesian analysis (0.97), forming a distinct sister clade to H. andreassenii and Coleodesmium
sp. ANT. Molecular data confirmed the distinctiveness of our tropical populations that show similarity values
of 98.4% with H. andreassenii, 97.8-98.1% with the H. antarctica assemblage, 97.8% with H. byssoidea, and
finally 98.5% with Coleodesmium sp. ANT.

Discussion
In the last decade the family Microchaetaceae has had important changes; the recent addition of new genericlevel taxa indicates a great activity derived from the study of new or not well known habitats, such as tropical
or extreme ones (Flechtner et al. 2002, Cassamata et al. 2006, Sant’Anna et al. 2010, Novis & Visnovsky
2011, Lamprinou et al. 2012, Hauer et al. 2013). These taxa were described mainly using a polyphasic
approach including molecular methods, but when this was not possible new taxa description has been based
on a detailed morphological and ecological characterization of populations (Sant’Anna et al. 2010). However,
whenever possible, new species descriptions must be carried out with combined molecular, morphological
and ecological data. The development of a logical and robust classification system is essential, this being a
baseline for diversity estimations and ecological, taxonomical or ecophysiological interpretations (Komárek
2006, 2010). It is considering this recommendation that we describe this new species. According to the
revised taxonomic classification system of Komárek & Anagnostidis (1989) and Komárek & Hauer (2013), in
terms of morphology, our populations clearly belong to the family Microchaetaceae, and correspond
phenotypically to genus Hassallia, as they show many typical characters attributed to this genus either in its
original description or in recent studies (Komárek et al. 2012) such as growth form, cell morphology,
trichome polarity, type of false branching, sheath type and color, as well as reproductive structures.
There are eleven valid and recognized Hassallia species (Table 1) (Komárek & Hauer 2013) including
four new species described from Antarctica and desert soils biotopes (Flechtner et al. 2008, Komárek et al.
2012) but none had been recorded from a similar biotope (tropical marine supralittoral) and geographical area
(Table 1). In general, the lack of reports of cyanobacterial genera such as Hassallia in many geographical
regions, and specially in marine habitats from tropical zones, is not due to its rare distribution or low
abundance in natural communities, but to the lack of studies in habitats of very specific environmental
conditions where cyanobacteria form frequently dominant multispecific assemblages.

This new species of Hassallia is phenotypically distinguished from all other species of the genus (Table 1)
mainly by growth form, cell and trichome dimensions and distinctive sheath features: terminal part widening,
funnel-like or “wing-like” (Figs. 15, 16, 24, 25), with evident gelatinization. In adittion, it differs from the rest
of species of this genus in its specific habitat. Only few species of Hassallia had been sequenced to date (H.
byssoidea, H. andreassenii and H. antartica assemblage); the difference of 16S rRNA genetic similarity
among these strains and our population was 1.6–2.2%. The morphological and biotope differences, as well as
the high levels of genetic variation between our populations from those three species, support the proposal of
our population as a new taxon within genus Hassallia.
In our tree topology, H. littoralis formed a distinctive and well-supported clade within the Hassallia genus
using Bayesian analysis. Hassallia byssoidea (type species) appears as a basal group, and H. andreassenii and
Coleodesmium sp. ANT, form a sister clade to H. littoralis. The phylogenetic position of Coleodesmium sp. ANT
(Taton et al. 2006) is within the Hassallia cluster, and phylogenetically close to H. andreassenii (Fig. 26), similar
to results obtained by Komárek et al. (2012). Interestingly, both Coleodesmium sp. ANT and H. andreassenii
have been isolated from Antarctica, therefore further studies are needed to compare these two strains.

FIGURE 26. Maximum-likelihood tree based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene of representatives of the families Scytonemataceae
and Microchaetaceae showing the position of the sequence obtained in the present study (in bold). Numbers at nodes indicate
bootstrap values ≥ 50% for Maximum Parsimony (left), Maximum Likelihood analysis (medium) and Bayesian posterior probabilities
(right) values.

GONZÁLEZ-RESENDIZ ET AL.

The identity of H. littoralis is moderately supported by bootstrap values in ML and MP topologies.
Similar modest support values have been documented in Microchaetaceae by Cassamatta et al. (2006);
Berrendero et al. (2011), Komárek et al. (2012), Lamprinou et al. (2012) and Hauer et al. (2013), the scarce
number of sequences available in this group probably influences these values. According to Berrendero et al.
(2011) and Hauer et al. (2013), the Microchaetaceae family needs a more detailed analysis of its members.
Our analysis supports this opinion, we consider that further inventory studies are still necessary, particularly in
tropical and extreme areas, which have shown to have a notorious diversity of previously undescribed
cyanobacteria (Komárek & Komárková 2007).
