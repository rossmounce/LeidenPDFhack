Abstract
The new palm genus Sabinaria (Cryosophileae, Coryphoideae, Arecaceae) and the new species Sabinaria magnifica
from the Colombia-Panama border are described and illustrated. Sabinaria differs from other genera in the tribe in the
leaf blades with a single deep, medial, abaxial split, and short abaxial splits in each segment, mostly unisexual flowers
with biseriate perianth, calyx connate with the corolla at a single place on its margin, large, tightly appressed, persistent
rachis bracts that hide the pistillate flowers, and fruits tightly packed and hidden among leaf bases, often covered by
litter.

Resumen
Se describen e ilustran el nuevo género de palmas Sabinaria (Cryosophileae, Coryphoideae, Arecaceae) y la nueva
especie Sabinaria magnifica, de la frontera entre Colombia y Panamá. Sabinaria difiere de otros géneros en la tribu por
la lámina foliar con una sola división abaxial central y cortas divisiones abaxiales en cada uno de los segmentos, flores
principalmente unisexuales con perianto biseriado, cáliz connato con la corola en un solo punto en su margen, grandes
brácteas del raquis fuertemente adpresas y persistentes, que ocultan las flores pistiladas, y frutos apiñados, ocultos entre
las bases de las hojas y a menudo cubiertos por hojarasca.

Introduction
The Serranía del Darién, the mountain range that forms the border between Colombia and Panama, is one of
the most poorly botanised areas in both countries, due to difficult access. Paradoxically, this area is of the
utmost relevance, having been the bottleneck for the migration of the land biota between North America and
South America after the final closure of the isthmus, now believed to have taken place in the Miocene, 15
Mya (Montes et al. 2012), rather than in the Pliocene, as formerly assumed (Taylor 1991). Recent exploration
in the northern foothills of the Serranía (Hoyos-Gómez et al. 2013) has started to reveal a fascinating flora.
Among palms, several interesting findings have been made, including a remarkable fan palm in the tribe
Cryosophileae, which represents a hitherto undescribed genus.

Materials and methods
We first studied an incomplete herbarium specimen of the new species kept at JAUM and then collected
specimens ourselves at the type locality, including flowers at anthesis and ripe fruits. We compared this
material with available descriptions of all coryphoid genera (Dransfield et al. 2008) and with herbarium
specimens and living plants of most genera in the tribe Cryosophileae.

Sabinaria R. Bernal & Galeano gen. nov.
Diagnosis. Solitary, unarmed, monoecious palm with induplicately palmate leaves, the petiole basally split, the blade
silvery whitish below, medially divided almost to the base by an abaxial split, the two halves lacking any further
deep abaxial splits, but with a short abaxial split present at the apex of each leaf segment. Inflorescence interfoliar,
branched to 1–2 orders, each branch subtended by a large, conspicuous bract, with mostly unisexual flowers,
staminate ones exposed beyond the bracts, with 20–23 stamens connate by their broadened filament bases, the
pistillate flowers restricted to the lower portion of the proximal rachillae and hidden by large persistent rachis bracts,
with a single carpel and staminodes with no anthers, a few pistillate flowers sometimes bearing 1–2 anthers. Fruit
uniseminate, with eccentric, inconspicuous, stigmatic remain. Endosperm homogeneous, embryo basal. Seedling
with undivided eophyll. Differs from other Cryosophileae in the lack of deep abaxial splits besides the medial one,
the unisexual flowers, the large, persistent rachis bracts that hide the pistillate flowers, and the tightly packed fruits
hidden among the leaf bases. Most closely resembles Itaya, from which it differs in the unisexual flowers with the
sepals connate with the petals at one single place, the large rachis bracts that hide the basal portion of the rachillae,
and the tightly packed fruits.

Description. Medium-sized, solitary, unarmed, pleonanthic, monoecious arborescent palm. Stem erect, with
inconspicuous leaf scars. Leaves numerous, induplicate, palmate; sheath medially split below the petiole, the
margins without fibres; petiole slender, long, biconvex, with sharp margins; adaxial hastula well developed,
truncate, abaxial hastula a low rim; blade medially divided almost to base by an abaxial split into two
symmetrical or slightly asymmetrical halves, these divided to ca. 1/10 their length into single fold segments
that are slightly bifid at apex; segments with inconspicuous cross-veins, the undersurface silvery-whitish.
Inflorescence interfoliar, branched to one order, basal rachillae sometimes with a few second-order rachillae;
prophyll bicarinate; peduncular bracts at least 5, large and inflated; rachis bracts similar to the peduncular
bracts, persistent and tightly appressed to the proximal portion of the rachilla and hiding the pistillate flowers;
rachillae straight, cylindrical. Flowers borne on a short pedicel and subtended by a small and narrow
triangular bract, mostly unisexual, pistillate ones on the proximal portion of proximal rachillae, the remaining
staminate, a few pistillate flowers sometimes bearing 1–2 anthers. Staminate flowers with three connate
sepals, these fused with the corolla at a single place on the margin; petals three, connate into a tubular corolla,
sometimes two of the petals completely free to base; stamens 20–23, exserted at anthesis, the filaments
connate by their fleshy bases into several irregular groups of 1–6, these in turn connate further below with
each other and basally adnate with the corolla, filiform at the apex; anthers oblong, dorsifixed, versatile, bifid
at base and apex. Pistillate flowers similar to the staminate ones; staminodes similar to the stamens but
lacking the anthers and the thin portion of the filament; gynoecium unicarpellate, eccentrically ovoid,
narrowed to a slender curved style and an oblique papillose stigma. Fruit obovoid to turbinate or subglobose,
uniseminate, with eccentric inconspicuous stigmatic remain; epicarp minutely tuberculate with sparse
perforations, smooth with the naked eye; mesocarp thick, endocarp not differentiated. Seed ovoid to
subglobose, with homogeneous endosperm; embryo basal. Seedling with lanceolate eophylls, whitish below.

Type:—COLOMBIA. Chocó: Municipio de Acandí, Quebrada El Brillante, 8 km southwest of
Capurganá, 130 m elev., 8°34’59.4” N, 77°23’09.9” W, 29 August 2013, G. Galeano, R. Bernal, S. Hoyos &
N. Echavarría 9062 (holotype: COL; isotypes: CHOCO, FMB, JAUM, K).
Etymology:—The Latin epithet magnifica refers to the strikingly beautiful aspect of the palm.
Habitat:—Known only from a small area at the base of the Serranía del Darién (Fig. 15), in the
Department of Chocó, northwestern Colombia, between 100 and 250 m elevation. The area lay less than one
kilometre away from the Colombia-Panama border, and the species most probably occurs also in that country.
The area is covered by premontane moist forest-warm transition (BMh-PM) in Holdridge’s life zone system
(IGAC 1977), with an average annual rainfall of ca. 3000 mm.

Conservation status:—There is too little information available on the distribution of Sabinaria
magnifica, and a assessment of its conservation status according to IUCN parameters is therefore not possible
at the present time. The area where the palm grows has extensive forests for many kilometres on both sides of
the Colombia-Panama border, and the palm was locally abundant, with hundreds of adults and plants in all
size categories. No major imminent threats appear to be operating in the area, although selective logging does
take place, and the zone is dangerously close to the Urabá region, one of the most severely deforested areas of
Colombia. Because of this, the protection of this area should be given a high priority, considering its pivotal
biogeographic relevance. The establishment of public and private protected areas in this zone should be
strongly encouraged.

Discussion
There is no doubt that the new species belongs to the tribe Cryosophileae, on account of its leaves with a
central abaxial split, and flowers with a single carpel. The latter character, as well as the numerous stamens,
are reminiscent of the Amazonian Itaya H.E.Moore (1972: 85), from which it differs in the unisexual flowers,
the pistillate ones restricted to the base of the proximal rachillae, and tightly hidden by the large persistent
rachis bracts, whereas in Itaya the rachis bracts are deciduous, and all flowers, which are hermaphroditic, are
exposed. This is reflected in the infructescence, which in Itaya has fruits throughout most of the rachillae (see
Galeano & Bernal 2010: fig. p. 113), whereas in Sabinaria fruits are restricted to the base of the lowermost
rachillae, and are thus hidden among the litter-trapping leaf bases (Fig. 12). In fact, seedlings are common on
the crown of most individuals.
The other genus in the Cryosophileae with biseriate perianth and unicarpellate gynoecium is the
Mesoamerican Schippia Burret (1933: 867), from Guatemala and Belize, which has hermaphroditic proximal
flowers and staminate distal ones, and six stamens. The only species in this genus, Schippia concolor Burret
(1933: 868), has small rachis bracts that do not hide the rachillae, flowers with a long stalk-like base, and
leaves deeply split into numerous, narrow, single-fold segments. As in Itaya, infructescences of Schippia have
fruits in most of their rachillae (see Dransfield et al. 2008, fig. p. 221), and the fruits are clearly exposed.
Leaf structure of Sabinaria is also unique among the Cryosophileae, as they have only one deep medial
abaxial split (Figs. 4–5), and lack any of the deep secondary splits that are common to the tribe. Although
some splits are often found in older leaves, these are irregularly located in either of the leaf halves, and are
obviously caused by falling branches or other external factors rather than by leaf ontogeny. Instead of deep
splits, each segment has a short, abaxial split ca. 5 mm long (Fig. 7).
Two unusual characters are found in the perianth of Sabinaria. First, the calyx is fused to the corolla at
one place on its margin (Fig. 11, E), so that calyx and corolla appear like a single tissue arranged in two
cycles. This character has not been recorded in the related Chelyocarpus, Cryosophila or Itaya (Castaño et al.
2011), nor in any other genus in the family (Dransfield et al. 2008). The ontogeny of this adnation deserves a
detailed study, particularly because, unlike Itaya, sepals and petals in Sabinaria are similarly thick. The
second unusual character of Sabinaria is the occasional lack of fusion between two of the petals, which results
in an open tube (Fig. 11, F). The combination of these two unusual characters results in a perianth that is
topologically uniseriate, although architecturally biseriate. This unusual perianth is particularly remarkable, as
the Cryosophileae include some genera with distinctively deviating perianth, like Chelyocarpus, which has
sepals and petals similar to each other, or Zombia, Coccothrinax, Hemithrinax, Leucothrinax, and Thrinax,
which have perianth in a single, six-toothed whorl (Dransfield et al. 2008). The perianth of Sabinaria might
represent an intermediate condition between the uniseriate and the biseriate perianth types found within the
tribe.
The pistillate flowers of Sabinaria, deeply hidden among the tight rachis bracts, restrict access to large
visitors like bees or large beetles. In the only inflorescence that we found in anthesis, there were trigonine bees
visiting the exposed staminate flowers, whereas only small mystropine beetles were found among the
pistillate flowers upon removing the bract.
The finding of Sabinaria in the contact zone between Mesoamerica and South America is particularly
interesting, as this area is completely isolated from the ranges of both Itaya and Schippia, the two other
Cryosophileae with unicarpellate gynoecium and biseriate perianth. Itaya, resolved as sister to all other
members of the tribe (Baker et al. 2009) or sister to all other members except for Chelyocarpus (Roncal et al.

2008), is found on the other side of the Andes, 1300 km away in northwestern Amazonia. Shippia, on the
other hand, is weakly supported either as sister to Cryosophila (Roncal et al. 2008), or to a clade comprising
Zombia, Coccothrinax, Hemithrinax, Leucothrinax and Thrinax (Baker et al. 2009). The nearest population of
Schippia is located ca. 1500 km northwest of Sabinaria. As it has been hypothesised that the unicarpellate
condition evolved independently in Itaya and Schippia (Rudall et al. 2011), the discovery of a third
unicarpellate member in the group, located in an area intermediate between them, may help clarify
relationships in the tribe, particularly the uncertain position of Schippia.

Conclusions
The finding of this new genus adds one more element to the intriguingly disjunct distribution of most genera
of the Cryosophileae and to their particular flower structure. Molecular, anatomical, and developmental
studies of Sabinaria, as well as comparative studies of reproductive biology among members of the tribe may
throw light on the evolution and dispersal of New World members of the Coryphoideae.
