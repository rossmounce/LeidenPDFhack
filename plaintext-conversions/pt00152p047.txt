Abstract
The sexuality of Solenostoma species is discussed and it is concluded that Solenostoma sanguinolentum is heteroicous.
This and other morphological differences from Solenostoma marcescens are discussed and they are considered to belong
to the same species. Heteroicity probably also occurs in Solenostoma micranthum and possibly in other Solenostoma
species. Solenostoma rossicum and Solenostoma pyriflorum subsp. purpureum are new synonyms to Solenostoma
sphaerocarpum. Solenostoma ochotense is a new synonym to Solenostoma hokkaidense. Solenostoma costaricanum is a
new synonym to Solenostoma amoenum. Plectocolea subbalfourii is a new synonym to Solenostoma balfourii.
Solenostoma rubrum var. underwoodii is a new synonym to Solenostoma rubrum. Plectocolea yunnanensis is a new
synonym to Solenostoma sikkimense. Solenostoma inundatum var. grandirete is a new synonym to Solenostoma
orbiculatum. Solenostoma kurilense and Solenostoma ovalifolia are new combinations and Solenostoma philippinense a
new species.

Bakalin & Vilnet (2012) described two new species and made one new combination in Solenostoma and two
new combinations in Plectocolea. Bakalin (2013) described four more taxa in Solenostoma and two in
Plectocolea based on specimens in NY. Recent molecular studies (e.g. Feldberg et al. 2009) have shown that
the two genera, as traditionally defined, can not be separated which is also shown by the phylogenetic tree in
Vilnet & Bakalin (2012). Some of their Plectocolea species are therefore transferred to Solenostoma.
In their papers describing new taxa within Solenostoma and Plectocolea, Bakalin & Vilnet (2012) and
Bakalin (2013) made two oversights. Firstly, they compared several of their new taxa with species that are not
closely related. Secondly, they overlooked to mention taxa that, based on previously published descriptions,
morphologically would be the closest relatives. The differences from their apparently closest relatives are
most often so small that they fall within the variation of the species. The present paper addresses these issues.
The format of this note follows that which is outlined in Söderström et al. (2012) except that the
Melbourne code of nomenclature (ICN; McNeill et al. 2012) is followed instead of the Vienna code (ICBN;
McNeill et al. 2006). All corresponding specimens in NY have been seen by the first author.
The distinction between Solenostoma sanguinolentum and Solenostoma marcescens, and some notes on
sexuality in Solenostoma
Bakalin (2013: 139) re-established Jungermannia marcescens Mitten (1861: 91) as a good species,
Solenostoma marcescens (Mitt.) Bakalin (2013: 139), which Váňa (1973: 68) placed in synonymy of
Solenostoma sanguinolentum (Griffith 1849: 302) Stephani (1901: 489). The experience with relatively
copious material by the senior author allows the following comments on the proposed differences between
Solenostoma sanguinolentum and Solenostoma marcescens.

Sexuality of plants:—According to the literature information, Jungermannia marcescens is described as
“dioica” (Stephani 1901: 503) or “dioicous?” (Amakawa 1967: 264). However, Amakawa states “the upper
leaves are often ventricose as if they contained antheridia”, but also “male inflorescence unknown”.
Solenostoma sanguinolentum is reported as “dioica” (Stephani 1901: 489) or “dioicous” (Amakawa 1967:
256). Bakalin (2013: 141) also wrote “Dioicous (? only female organs seen)”. No other information about the
sexuality of Solenostoma sanguinolentum or Solenostoma marcescens is known. Váňa (1973: 68) did not give
any information about the sexuality of Solenostoma sanguinolentum, only the note that “the type material of
Jungermannia marcescens Mitt. is identical in all characteristics with the material of Jungermannia
sanguinolenta Griff…”. Váňa & Long (2009: 507) also did not give any information about the sexuality of
Solenostoma sanguinolentum, only saying “Androecia (previously unknown in this species) intercalary, bracts
5–7 pairs, relatively remote, slightly saccate at base.” It is of course possible to assume that it can suggest that
Solenostoma sanguinolentum (syn. Solenostoma marcescens) should be dioicous, but that was never explicitly
said. Based on the above facts, the senior author was very careful and avoided publishing explicit information
about the sexuality of Solenostoma sanguinolentum or Solenostoma marcescens.
In the years before 1972 (cf. Váňa 1973: 68) and also after 1972 the senior author examined almost all
available material of Solenostoma sanguinolentum present in the herbaria BM, E, FH, G, JE, M, NICH, NY,
TNS, and W, as well as the material of many recent collections (except some collections made by Chinese
bryologists). Lectotypes and many iso(lecto)types of both Solenostoma sanguinolentum (BM – lectotype , FH,
G-672, NY - isolectotypes) and Solenostoma marcescens (BM – lectotype, FH, G-14835, NY, Wisolectotypes) were also studied. The material coll. J. Poelt (det. Grolle, M, JE), as well as the collections of
Japanese botanists (coll. Z. Iwatsuki, K. Yoda, det. Amakawa, NICH, TNS), the collections of G. and S. Miehe
(det. Váňa, MB) and especially the collections of D. Long (det. Váňa, E) contains mostly very good, optimally
developed material. Concerning the sexuality, the existence of pure gynoecial shoots with perianths
(sometimes with 3–5 ± saccate leaves just below the perianth or sometimes saccate leaves separated by 2–3
not saccate leaves from the perianth), pure androecial shoots (with terminal androecia and also intercalary
androecia, terminating by 3–5 pairs of sterile leaves up to the top of the shoot and no trace of archegonia) and
one (- three?) paroicous shoot was confirmed.
Gynoecial shoots without saccate leaves below gynoecium were very common, they are present in nearly
all specimens examined, as well as in the type specimens of Solenostoma sanguinolentum and Solenostoma
marcescens. Gynoecial shoots with saccate leaves below gynoecium were not common, but they were found
in the type material of Solenostoma marcescens, and in some other specimens (never in the type specimens of
Solenostoma sanguinolentum). In contrast, pure androecial shoots were very rare. They were never found in
the type specimens of Solenostoma sanguinolentum. Neither could Bakalin find the androecia in the
isolectotype specimen in NY 967468. Two pure androecial shoots were found in the lectotype specimen of
Solenostoma marcescens in BM (Bakalin did not mention pure androecial shoots in the specimen NY
961508), and sometimes found in the specimen coll. Yoda (det. Amakawa as Jungermannia sanguinolenta,
TNS 11879), and coll. Long 21570 (det. Váňa as Jungermannia sanguinolenta, E). The issue is complicated
by the fact that the leaves are relatively large and only slightly saccate (if at all) at their bases, not
characteristically saccate as in many other species of Solenostoma. In the saccate leaves immediately below
gynoecia antheridia were never found, only some sterile filaments and primordials of lateral branches were
often present. Examination of the saccate leaves somewhat distant from gynoecium resulted in the finding
(twice) of some traces which may be interpreted as the rest of antheridial stalk or something like a filament.
Well developed antheridia with antheridial stalks were found only once in the course of re-examination of the
isotype material of Solenostoma marcescens in BM. One leaf with two relatively well developed antheridia
(open) was present. The antheridial stalks were 1-cell wide at the base, and, in part, 2-cells wide above.
Bakalin (at least according the information presented in the article) examined only the isotype specimens
of Solenostoma marcescens and of Solenostoma sanguinolenta in NY and there is no information about the
study of any additional specimens. He (Bakalin 2013: 139) found that “the type material of J. marcescens is
paroicous, not dioicous as in S. sanguinolentum. Antheridia below the perianth are often lacking in this

VÁŇA ET AL.

species, however, and are present in approximately every third shoot. This situation is rather common in the
paroicous species of Solenostoma where antheridia are easily washed away when herbarium material is wetted.
The paroicous state also suggested by the constant fertilization of the archegonia in the absence of antheridial
shoots.” This statement of Bakalin is correct, but he is not the first one showing the described problem.
It should be mentioned that Bakalin, who was the first to discover paroicous inflorescence in the isotype
specimen of Solenostoma marcescens, like all previous authors considered Solenostoma sanguinolentum as
dioicous (on the basis of examination of the isotype in NY) and on this basis as a separate taxon from
Solenostoma marcescens. Unfortunately, it is not possible (at least in the present time by present methods) to
confirm the statement by molecular methods because both types were collected in 19th century.
Taking the above observations of Váňa and of Bakalin into consideration (both considered correct), we
have only one species (where the name Solenostoma sanguinolentum has priority), highly proterandrous with
heteroicous (not exactly paroicous nor exactly dioicous) inflorescence. The proposed new combination
Solenostoma marcescens (Mitt.) Bakalin is superfluous and falls in the synonymy of Solenostoma
sanguinolentum. Jungermannia marcescens Mitt. cannot be treated as a “good” species (as already stated by
Váňa 1973: 68). Heteroicity is not unknown in the genus Solenostoma and similar genera, but it is not
common. It has been reported a few times in Solenostoma paroicum (Schiffner 1910: 320) Schuster (1953:
402) (Váňa 1975: 83, Paton 1999: 285), Solenostoma subellipticum (Heeg 1893: 69) Schuster (1969: 1021)
(Damsholt 2002: 232), Jungermannia pumila Withering (1796: 866) (cf., e.g., Damsholt 2002: 203, Váňa et
Engel 2013: 76), Jungermannia polaris Lindberg (1867: 560) (Damsholt 2002: 206), and possibly also in
Solenostoma obovatum (Nees 1833:332) Massalongo (1903: 17) (Paton 1999: 285). Also the presence of
sterile leaves between perianth and androecium was mentioned e.g. for Jungermannia pumila, Solenostoma
paroicum and Solenostoma subellipticum (Damsholt 2002: 227, 230).
It is also worth mentioning that Bakalin described Nardia geoscyphus (De Notaris 1859: 486) Lindberg
(1874) var. dioica Bakalin et al. (2010: 87) on the basis of different sexuality only. (N. geoscyphus var.
geoscyphus is paroicous). In the footnote on the same page Bakalin correctly presented the published
information of Váňa (1976: 379) which in the type plants of Nardia geoscyphoides Amakawa (1957: 167)
(described as dioicous) found two subinvolucral bracts on the female inflorescence with antheridial stalks and
fragments of an antheridium wall; this species was reduced into synonymy of Nardia geoscyphus. Maybe
Nardia geoscyphus var. dioica represents the same problem as was found in the cases of Nardia
geoscyphoides and Solenostoma sanguinolentum / marcescens, simply high proterandry.
A probably identical case concerns Lophoziopsis excisa (Dickson 1793: 11) Konstantinova & Vilnet
(2010: 66) and Lophoziopsis propagulifera (Gottsche 1890: 451) Konstantinova & Vilnet (2010: 67),
discussed in detail in Váňa et Engel (2013: 75–76) where Lophoziopsis excisa is reported as paroicous and
Lophoziopsis propagulifera as dioicous (Stephani 1902: 139), paroicous (Schuster 1969a: 521) or dioicous,
rarely paroicous or autoicous (Bakalin 2005: 100). This problem was intensively studied by molecular
methods by Vilnet et al. (2007, 2008); and the authors could not resolve Lophoziopsis propagulifera as a
distinct species. In that study Lophoziopsis propagulifera (based on a specimen from the Kamchatka region)
forms a separate clade with Lophoziopsis excisa (based on collections from the Murmansk area and
Spitzbergen). They stated (Vilnet et al. 2008: 412) that “in view of the quite similar level of sequence
divergences within Lophozia excisa, and between Lophozia propagulifera and Lophozia excisa, it is not
possible to resolve the taxonomic status of Lophozia propagulifera. If we recognize the latter taxon at the
species level, then the Spitzbergen specimens of Lophozia excisa should be treated as separate species, too.”
The cladograms in the molecular studies of Vilnet et al. (2007, 2008) reveal that Lophoziopsis propagulifera
should be separated at the specific level only if we accept additional “microspecies” within the Lophoziopsis
excisa complex and disregard influence of ecological factors on the sexuality of the plants. Maybe similar
problems are more common in autoicous species where this phenomenon is more complicated as the autoicity
sometimes is difficult to detect because of disintegration of basal parts of the shoots. The many times
discussed and not yet fully clarified problem of Lophocolea bidentata / coadunata may be mentioned in this
context (cf. also discussion in Váňa et Engel 2013: 41–43).

Perianth:—Bakalin (2013: 139) stated “The perianth in J. marcescens is bistratose in the lower 2/3 of its
length, and in S. sanguinolentum only in the lower third” and “The perianth of S. sanguinolentum is much
larger than in J. marcescens (up to 6 mm long, vs. to 1.5 mm long)”. In all of about 40 specimens examined by
the senior author the perianths were bistratose from 1/4 to 3/4. Young perianths were bistratose only in the
lower half whereas mature perianths were bistratose mostly to 2/3–3/4. This character is naturally correlated
with the length of the perianth and also with the length of the emergence of perianth from the female bracts. It
should be mentioned that the perianths are fully mature in the type of Solenostoma sanguinolentum, which is
the source of Bakalin’s observation (and thus bistratose to 2/3–3/4 and 0.7–0.8 emergent), whereas the ones in
the type of Solenostoma marcescens are not fully mature (and thus bistratose to 1/3–1/2 and about 0.5
emergent). The maturity of the perianth is the reason no antheridia were found in the type plants of
Solenostoma sanguinolentum by any author including Bakalin. Thus, bistratosity and the size of the perianth
does not separate Solenostoma sanguinolentum from Solenostoma marcescens.
Colouration:—Bakalin (2013: 139) wrote “The typical coloration of J. marcescens plants is yellowish
brownish to brown, as was noted by Mitten (1861), Amakawa (1966) and observed in the study of the first
author. In contrast, the typical coloration of S. sanguinolenthum [sic!; in the article Bakalin used both forms:
“sanguinolentum” and “sanguinolenthum”] is light to deep pink. As noted by Váňa (1972[=1973]) greencoloured plants of S. sanguinolenthum may occur, but the green coloration can be treated as merely the
absence of secondary pigmentation. The presence of brown pigmentation versus pink in the well-exposed
phases is quite another matter. Correlated with this feature is the rhizoid coloration; it is colorless to pinkish in
S. sanguinolenthum versus brown to golden brown and red-brownish in J. marcescens.”
This information (except “brown”) is the same as presented in Amakawa (1966: 256, 264). It is more
precise in Stephani (1901: 489 “superne sanguinea” and 508 “pallide flavo-virens”). Examining a wide
spectrum of specimens, it will be found that the colour may be green, yellow-green, yellowish brown, pinkish
to in some parts tinged with purplish. Also the type plants of Solenostoma marcescens have partly purplish
perianths. The purplish colour is the reaction to the occurrence in sunny places (a similar situation is very well
known e.g. in Mylia taylorii (Hooker 1813: pl. 57) Gray (1821: 693)). The colour of old specimens is mostly
pale or yellowish, which probably is caused by the decolouration of green plants after many years. Recent
collections (at least the ones examined) are mostly green and tinged with purple.
Rhizoid colouration should, according to Bakalin, be correlated with the colour of plants. The source of
this information is probably Stephani (1901: 489, 508), who described rhizoids of Solenostoma
sanguinolentum as “pallidis” and of Solenostoma marcescens as “purpureis”. This statement cannot be fully
confirmed; golden brown to red brownish rhizoids are also present in some plants of the type of Solenostoma
sanguinolenta as well as in many other specimens, and this character is never correlated with the colour of
leaves or perianths. Many times rhizoids of the same specimen may be light brown to intensive purple. Thus,
“brown” rhizoids and “yellowish brownish to brown” pigmentation can not be used to separate Solenostoma
marcescens and Solenostoma sanguinolentum .
Pachydermous leaf cell structure:—Bakalin (2013: 139) stated that “J. marcescens has rather
pachydermous leaf cells, versus leptodermous in S. sanguinolenthum; this character correlates with the
former’s more rigid plant habit than the latter”. This character was also given by Amakawa (1967: 264 “walls
slightly thickened”). This character of cells, based on ecology (light), is not constant even in the type plants of
Solenostoma marcescens as some plants have cells with thin walls. Bakalin’s drawing (fig. 8: 5) also does not
agree with this. Again, a wide spectrum of this character (slightly pachydermous to leptodermous cells) can be
found in the examined material. Thus, we conclude that leaf cell structure (leptodermous or pachydermous) is
based on the ecological conditions and cannot be used to separate the taxa mentioned.
Bakalin (l.c.: 139) also stated that Solenostoma marcescens resembles species of the Solenostoma
pyriflorum Stephani (1917a: 83) group, whereas Solenostoma sanguinolentum is similar to those of the
Solenostoma fusiforme (Stephani 1897: 99) Schuster (1969: 944) group. It is difficult for us to find similarity
with Solenostoma pyriflorum or with Solenostoma fusiforme. Unpublished molecular data also confirms that
Solenostoma sanguinolentum is very distantly related to Solenostoma pyriflorum and Solenostoma fusiforme.

Conclusions:—Based on the characters discussed above, Bakalin (2013) concluded that Solenostoma
marcescens “is a ‘good’ taxon which is rather distant from S. sanguinolenthum” and makes the necessary
combination under Solenostoma. Our observations show no difference between Solenostoma sanguinolentum
(if we accept the heteroicous inflorescence for the taxon) and Solenostoma marcescens on the morphological
basis as the facts discussed above confirm the opinion presented in Váňa (1973: 68) and Váňa et Long (2009:
507) treating the taxa as conspecific. Until population studies based on molecular methods are at hand, there is
no reason to keep the two taxa apart.

Plectocolea micrantha
Bakalin (2013: 137) states that Solenostoma micranthum (Mitten 1873: 405) Váňa et al. (2010: 137) probably
is paroicous, not dioicous as thought until now. He found androecia just below the perianth which Mitten
(1873: 405), who described this species, did not find (according to Bakalin probably because they are
disappearing very quickly after fertilization), but Stephani (1901: 503), who only received one shoot, found
intercalary androecia. In the description of the type Bakalin wrote “androecia just below perianth” which does
not correspond with “intercalary androecia” described by Stephani (and confirmed by the senior author on the
G specimen from herb. Stephani). Bakalin did not present figures of paroicous plants (fig. 7:2 showed only
three antheridia, and archegonia are not in this figure as stated in the legend). If the statement of Bakalin is
correct, Solenostoma micranthum is probably not paroicous, but heteroicous (cf. e.g. Jungermannia pumila
and probably some other taxa incl. Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum Bakalin & Vilnet (2010: 159)).
Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum / Solenostoma pyriflorum
The above discussion brings up the question of the taxonomy of the Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum /
pyriflorum complex including Solenostoma rishiriense Amakawa (1956: 48), which Bakalin & Vilnet (2010:
159) accepted as a separate species. Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum was separated by Bakalin & Vilnet (l.c.:
160) from Solenostoma pyriflorum on the basis of the paroicous inflorescence. In the same study they (l.c.:
160) stated “one of its striking features is an easy disintegration of antheridia and only loosely or almost not
inflated base of male bracts”. Some of the specimens were formerly recorded as Solenostoma rishiriense
(Gambaryan 1992, Bakalin 2009a: 230) and Solenostoma pyriflorum (Váňa & Ignatov 2005, Bakalin
2009b:108). It should be mentioned that the identification of two specimens by the senior author (attributed to
Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum by Bakalin & Vilnet 2010: 160) was based only on the fact that one specimen
has only terminal androecia and the second one is fully sterile (at least the parts of specimens available for
examination).
The separation of Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum is partly supported by molecular data (trnL-F cpDNA).
In Bakalin & Vilnet (2010: 153) in both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees
Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum (5 specimens from Eastern Siberia) form a separate clade sister to a clade
based on two specimens of Solenostoma pyriflorum from South Korea (from the same or nearly the same
locality). Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum demonstrates “a stable and almost invariable sequence pattern over
extensive territory of about 300 km, from Baikal to Kuril Islands” (l. c.: 155) and the “data support the
segregation of Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum as a separate species distinct from S. pyriflorum.” It should be
only mentioned that Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum replaces Solenostoma pyriflorum north of 40º N latitude.
In the study Bakalin & Vilnet (2012: 570) used the combined trnL-F + trnG intron nucleotide sequence where
Solenostoma pseudopyriflorum forms a separate basal clade in the major clade formed by Solenostoma
pyriflorum, Solenostoma major (Hattori 1950: 8) Bakalin & Vilnet (2012: 574) (= Solenostoma pyriflorum
var. major (S.Hatt.) Bakalin (2009a: 230)) and “Solenostoma sp.”.

Solenostoma rossicum
Bakalin et Vilnet (2012: 571) also described a new species Solenostoma rossicum stated to be similar to
Solenostoma sphaerocarpum, but differing in common presence of reddish pigmentation and heteroicous
inflorescence. In the phylogenetic tree (using a Bayesian approach) five specimens of Solenostoma rossicum
form a separate clade to Solenostoma sphaerocarpum, formed by two clades based on nine specimens
analysed from Russia and Svalbard. Based on the molecular data obtained, the authors concluded that in spite
of the low molecular divergence (“without significant support”) between Solenostoma rossicum and the
related species (e.g. Solenostoma sphaerocarpum and Solenostoma confertissimum (Nees 1833: 277)
Schljakov (1980: 239), probably also with Solenostoma caucasicum (Váňa 1970: 96) Konstantinova et al.
(1992: 123) compared to the other taxa discussed by them), they preferred to treat Solenostoma rossicum as a
separate species due to its “heteroicous inflorescence, a noticeable whitish to pale brownish colored stem
especially in the lower part, and a peculiar absence of sepia or sepia-brown pigmentation”.
The two morphological features used to distinguish the new species are colouration and heteroicous
inflorescences. Reddish pigmentation is present only in the form of “purplish red colored leaf margin and the
shoot tips” (l.c. p. 571) or “only in the perianth tips” (l.c. p. 573). In spite of contradictory information on
different pages of the same study it is clear that the purple colour is present only in the most exposed parts of
the plants. Reddish colour was not reported until now in Solenostoma sphaerocarpum except for the
information in the description of Jungermannia pusilla (Jensen 1912: 92) Buch (1936: 71) in Amakawa
(1960: 59 “tinged with purple”). Japanese specimens of Jungermannia pusilla were erroneously identified and
belong to Solenostoma sphaerocarpum (Váňa 1974c: 396). The “pale brownish colored stem especially in the
lower part, and the peculiar absence of sepia or sepia-brown pigmentation” in Solenostoma rossicum falls
within the variability of the very polymorphous Solenostoma sphaerocarpum. Bakalin & Vilnet also stated
that although the main diagnostic feature of the new species is a heteroicous inflorescence they are describing
both a “paroicous phase” and a “dioicous phase”. The occurrence of “paroicous phase” and “heteroicous
phase”, as the they wrote (l.c.: 573) is not surprising. This situation is not unknown in the genus Solenostoma
and similar genera, but it is not common (cf. above).
Solenostoma sphaerocarpum is distributed in Siberia across the whole Siberian Arctic, Solenostoma
rossicum in Khabarovsk territory, Sakhalin I. and Kuril Islands. It should be added that one voucher specimen
for the molecular analysis used in the mentioned paper was from Yakutia Rep. (outside of the mentioned
area). Moreover, from the neighboring Japan only Solenostoma sphaerocarpum was reported.
Our opinion on Solenostoma rossicum is influenced by the above discussion about proterandry and
heteroicity of Solenostoma sanguinolentum, Jungermannia pumila and other species. It is a question if the
highly proterandric, common and widely distributed species (not only in North America, Eurasia, but also in
South America, Africa etc.) may, under the specific circumstances occur as a heteroicous taxon. It is possible
that in the very limited range (Khabarovsky territory, Sakhalin I. and Kuril Is.) some genetical segregation
occurs. But this question may be only answered by population and molecular studies of Solenostoma
sphaerocarpum using voucher specimens from different areas. The present results of the molecular study (not
fully significant according to the authors) and the above mentioned information about morphology and
phytogeography support the opinion that Solenostoma rossicum represents a “heteroicous phase” of
Solenostoma sphaerocarpum only.
The above opinion was confirmed by the re-study of a paratype specimen (coll. K. Holmen 14.643, C!,
PRC!) of Solenostoma pyriflorum subsp. purpureum (Schuster & Damsholt 1974: 178) by the senior author.
The mentioned taxon was transferred to Solenostoma sphaerocarpum as Jungermannia sphaerocarpa subsp.
purpurea (R.M.Schust. & Damsh.) (Damsholt 2011: 102). The difference from Solenostoma sphaerocarpum
subsp. sphaerocarpum is the “heteroicous rarely paroicous” inflorescence, “shoot usually with purplish
secondary pigmentation” and “small-leaved shoots frequently present” (the last character concerns var.
innovata). Comparing the isotype specimen (var. purpureum) with the description of Solenostoma rossicum

Solenostoma major
Bakalin & Vilnet (2012: 574) elevated Solenostoma pyriflorum var. major to specific rank. The molecular data
for this and their value was already discussed under Solenostoma rossicum above. Morphologically, this taxon
is separated from Solenostoma pyriflorum by the following characteristics: a) “deep purple rhizoid coloration
versus colorless to brownish and light rose in S. pyriflorum”. However, the rhizoids in the Japanese plants
including the type are “colorless or purple” (cf. Amakawa 1960: 62). b) “wide, flattened, undulate and distant
leaves versus concave, not undulate and contiguous leaves”. Again, Japanese plants including the type have
“somewhat concave” and not undulate leaves (cf. Amakawa 1960: 62). c) A tendency to occupy wet habitats.
This character is based on only two specimens from South Korea collected on “banks of stream, where it is
commonly growing submerged” (but Solenostoma pyriflorum also occurs on wet rocks). Thus, we regard the
taxon as a modification that with the present knowledge at most deserves recognition at varietal rank.
Solenostoma ochotense
Bakalin & Vilnet (2012: 575) described Solenostoma ochotense from plants collected in Kamchatka and the
Kuril Islands. Samples in their molecular phylogeny come out as a monophyletic group sister to Solenostoma
fusiforme and they compare it with this species, Solenostoma koreanum Stephani (1917a: 81) and
Solenostoma hyalinum (Hooker 1814: tab. 63) Mitten (1870: 319). However, no samples of Solenostoma
hokkaidense were included in their phylogeny and they do not mention that taxon at all although it is
described from the region. Type plants of Solenostoma hokkaidense are poorly developed, where as Bakalin’s
plants are mostly optimally developed. Based on this fact, the leaf cells in Russian plants (especially the basal
ones) are larger than in the type plants, but falls within the range of variation. This is probably an endemic
taxon known only from Kamchatka Peninsula and Kuril Is. in Russia and Rishiri I. (Japan), the area of extant
or extinct volcanic activity.

Plectocolea kurilensis
Bakalin & Vilnet (2012: 569) wrote “The relationship observed here between P. kurilensis and clade of P.
rigidula and three poorly known Plectocolea species from South Korea is not well supported...” “Therefore,
P. kurilensis appears to be a more heterogeneous species, with a complicated infraspecific structure that could
be clarified by analyzing additional samples”. Bakalin (l. c.: 579) considered this species “most superficially
similar to both P. infusca s. str. and P. rosulans” and compared it with the two mentioned species. However,
the phylogenetic tree based on combined trnL-F + trnG does not show the close relationship of Plectocolea
kurilensis to Solenostoma infuscum (Mitten 1891: 196) Hentschel et al. (2007: 152) and Solenostoma rosulans
(Stephani 1897: 101) Váňa & Long (2009: 507). Moreover, in the cladogram two specimens of Plectocolea
kurilensis from Japan are included, which are not mentioned in the description of Plectocolea kurilensis.
Because the authors gave no information about the localities of voucher specimens, nothing more is known
about these samples. They are placed in the basal position and they may represent “morphologically
ambiguous samples” (l.c.: 569). In our opinion, the plants of this species are much more similar
(morphologically) to Plectocolea ovalifolia than to any of the above mentioned species, at least according to
drawings (l.c.: fig. 5 and 6). This taxon seems to be problematical and heterogeneous, and future studies on
molecular and morphological basis will probably help to clarify its value. In the meantime a transfer to
Solenostoma is necessary.

Plectocolea ovalifolia
The morphological differences between Plectocolea ovalifolia and Solenostoma infuscum (var. infuscum) are
small (only uniformly oval leaves are significant). The size of plants and purple rhizoids are not important
differences as the same size and purple rhizoids are known also in Solenostoma infuscum. However, according
to molecular data (Bakalin & Vilnet 2012: 569) it probably represents a good taxon of specific rank
(belonging to different clades) and they elevate Plectocolea infusca var. ovalifolia to the species rank,
Plectocolea ovalifolia. A transfer to Solenostoma is necessary.

Solenostoma costaricanum
Some years ago, at a visit to the NY herbarium, the senior author studied the specimen and identified it as
Jungermannia amoena (now Solenostoma amoenum). The sentence in Bakalin (2013: 129) “The specimen
was identified as Jungermannia (Solenostoma) amoena Lindenb. & Gottsche…” concerns this determination.
Bakalin disagrees with this determination and described and figured a new species, Solenostoma
costaricanum, on the basis of this specimen. He compared it with Solenostoma crassulum (Nees & Montagne
1836: 54) Stephani (1901: 497) and Solenostoma amoenum. The comparison with Solenostoma crassulum

does not deserve any comments since that the observations are correct but the two taxa are not closely related.
There are more differences between them that is not mentioned by Bakalin. Concerning the differences from
Solenostoma amoenum Bakalin’s descriptions are quoted below, followed by our comments: a) “androecia in
3–4 pairs (vs. 6–12)”. The difference is based on the description by Váňa (1974a: 189). But the number of
male bracts is not fully constant, in the time of the writing of the description the senior author saw only
optimally developed specimens with 6–12 pairs and specimens studied later showed that the variability of this
character is wider. b) “sometimes a shortly beaked perianth mouth (vs. rounded, not beaked)”, but in the
description the author wrote “commonly very weakly beaked or not beaked mouth”. Also the character is very
variable and of no taxonomic significance. c) “flaccid shoots (vs. rigid)”. Again only ecological adaptation of
no taxonomic value. d) “absence of a perigynium (vs. common presence)” compare again the description by
Váňa (1974a: 183): “Perigynium vorhanden oder fehlt” [perigynium present or missing].
As an addition it should be mentioned that the drawing is not instructive and not fully corresponding with
the description, e.g. “leaves… transversely elliptic to reniform”, “leaf cells … along margin … thin-walled,
with thin- to slightly thickened external wall…”. All characters of this specimen fall within the variability of
Solenostoma amoenum.

Plectocolea subbalfourii
In the examination of the duplicate specimen of the type of Bakalin’s new species Plectocolea subbalfourii,
received as a gift from T. Pócs by the senior author, only sterile plants were found, intermixed with plants of
Marchantia and Riccardia. Recently the richer isotype specimen (Bakalin examined the smaller duplicate
deposited in NY; moreover the first author have also a smaller duplicate) from the herbarium of Prof. T. Pócs
(coll. Vojtkó/A,B,C; EGR) was received for re-examination. Between rhizoids of Marchantia one shoot with a
perianth of “Plectocolea”-type was found. Based on this, the former identification by the senior author as
Jungermannia borgenii Pearson (1892: 11) [=Solenostoma borgenii (Pearson) Stephani (1901: 493)] must be
corrected. Bakalin (2013: 129) compared the specimen with Solenostoma balfourii, which was described on
the basis of very sparse and poorly developed plants also from NY herbarium. He does not mention if he
examined the type of Solenostoma balfourii, but he apparently compared the plants with the original
description. According to Bakalin the differences from Solenostoma balfourii are as follows: a) “a higher
perigynium ca. 0.6–0.7 of perianth length (vs. 0.3–0.5 of perianth length in Solenostoma balfourii)”. One
shoot with perianth found in EGR specimen has perigynium only ca. 0.4 of the perianth length (not 0.6–0.7 of
the perianth length). b) “obliquely to erect spreading rhizoids, mostly not fasciculate (vs. forming more or less
clear fascicles)”. The rhizoids in the original (EGR) and duplicate (PRC) specimens sometimes (in the
perianth bearing plant) form a decurrent fascicle, in the sterile shoots the fascicle is “less clear”. c) “not
rhizogenous leaves (vs. rhizogenous)”. In the original description by Váňa (1974b: 280) rhizoids are
mentioned as “von basalen Blatt- und Perigyniumzellen entspringend“ [originating from basal leaf and
perigynium cells], which does not fully correspond to the term “rhizogenous leaves”. In the specimens
examined the rhizoids originate also from basal leaf cells and perigynium cells as in original specimen. d)
“larger midleaf cells, up to 70 × 57 μm (vs. 28–35 μm)”. In the original description (based on poorly
developed plants) the marginal cells are 25–30 μm, median ones 28–35 μm and the basal ones 45–60 × 30–35
μm. EGR and PRC specimens have the median cells a little bit larger (median cells 30–50 μm, basal ones up
to 65 μm). In fact, the cells of well developed plants of Solenostoma balfourii are a little bit larger than in the

type specimen. The larger cell size for the species was confirmed by the study of one additional specimen of
this species known from Réunion (coll. Gimalac 75.R.963; herb. Onraedt). In addition, Bakalin (2013: fig. 2:
8, 9) does not show smooth cell surface although the description state “cuticle smooth”.

Solenostoma rubrum var. underwoodii
Bakalin (2013: 131) described the new variety from the NY copy of Hepaticae Americanae [not Exsiccatae
Hepaticae Americanae] no. 169. The following comments are based on the description of Solenostoma
rubrum in Váňa (1974c: 398–399) and on the examination of one of the three mentioned specimens
distributed in the exsiccata Hepaticae Americanae no. 169 from the herbarium FI. Bakalin distinguished his
new variety from the nominal variety in the following way: a) “purplish pale violet coloration (vs. commonly
red coloration in var. rubrum)”. Váňa (1974c: 398) states “In schwach bis stark purpurroten, seltener in
grünen bis gelbgrünen … Rasen…” [in somewhat to intensive purplish, rarely in green to yellow-green
patches…]. Some specimens of Solenostoma rubrum are not completely red and the FI specimen of Hepaticae
Americanae no. 169 has mostly pinkish to pale red colour, some shoots are red. (cf. also e.g. Frye & Clark
1943: 330 “green to reddish green”. b) “very small to virtually absent trigones inward of the leaf margin (vs.
well developed)”. In the FI specimen the trigones are small, but not absent. c) “mostly subequally thickened
leaf rim cells (vs. strongly unequally thickened, commonly with large trigones)”. Nearly all specimens of
Solenostoma rubrum examined have sub-equally thickened marginal leaf cells. d) “a long exserted perianth
(up to 4/5 or even more vs. shortly to 1/2–3/5 of its length exserted)”. This character is depending on the
maturity of perianth. We do not see any morphological differences from Solenostoma rubrum justifying a
separation as a new taxon.

Plectocolea yunnanensis
According to Bakalin (2013: 132) this new species from the Solenostoma truncatum (Nees 1830: 29) Váňa &
Long (2009 : 509) complex is closely related to Plectocolea boninensis (Horikawa 1934: 142) Hattori (1944:
37), Plectocolea granulata (Stephani 1897: 100) Bakalin (2013: 132) and Plectocolea shinii (Amakawa 1970:
156) Bakalin (2013: 132), all of which were synonymized by Váňa and Inoue (1983: 132, 134) with the very
common and variable Solenostoma truncatum. Bakalin (l.c.: 133) with his narrow species concept of
Solenostoma accepted the three above mentioned species as separate taxa and regarded the decision of Váňa
& Inoue (1983: 132, 134) as “premature” and “additional studies including molecular analyses are needed to
resolve this question.” We agree with this reasoning, yet we maintain there is no new evidence at hand to
warrant recognition of these taxa However, Bakalin’s new species is fully identical with Solenostoma
sikkimense, a species not at all mentioned in the text.

Solenostoma gracillimum subsp. camiguinense
Bakalin (2013: 134) described a new subspecies of the mainly northern boreal and temperate Solenostoma
gracillimum (Smith & Sowerby 1811: tab. 2238) Schuster (1969: 972) and stated that the plants differ from
typical Solenostoma gracillimum f. crenulatum (Mitten 1865: 51) Schuster (1969: 980) in “concave to slightly
convex trigones in the midleaf (vs. virtually absent), commonly not beaked mouth (vs. uniformly beaked) and
the perianth bistratose in lower third (vs. unistratose to base)”. Slightly thick-walled cells, loosely striolate cell
surface (cuticle) and absence of perigynium may also be added.
Contrary to Bakalin’s view that these differences as well as the collecting site’s extreme geographical
isolation from the other localities of Solenostoma gracillima qualify for a subspecific rank, there is strong
evidence that the plants should be separated on the species level. The new taxon is clearly different from all
species of Solenostoma with leaves bordered by one row of thick-walled cells [i.e. Solenostoma fusiforme,
Solenostoma gracillimum, Solenostoma handelii (Schiffner 1909: 135) Müller (1947: 38), Solenostoma
limbatifolium (Amakawa 1968: 112) Váňa & Long 2009: 504), Solenostoma rubrum, Solenostoma
suborbiculatum (Amakawa 1968: 112) Váňa & Long (2009: 508)], moreover, it is not closely related to
Solenostoma gracillimum nor to Solenostoma fusiforme. It is probably most closely related to the Himalayan
Solenostoma suborbiculatum, which differs from the new species by a suite of characters including: thinwalled, larger leaf cells (only marginal leaf cells thick-walled, only slightly larger than inner cells); leaves
with a nearly smooth cell surface; leaves not widely orbicular–reniform;,perianth plicate only in terminal
portion and with a distinct beak; and the presence of an erect perigynium, etc. A new name for the taxon is
provided below.
Solenostoma philippinense Váňa, sp. nov.
Description:—The description in Bakalin (2013: 134 sub Solenostoma gracillimum subsp. camiguinense) validates the
taxon.
Holotype:—PHILIPPINES. Is. of Camiguin, from around the fumaroles at the base of the New Volcano thrown up in
1871, Challenger Expedition s.n. s.d. (NY 1717840!).
≡ Solenostoma gracillimum subsp. camiguinense Bakalin, Polish Bot. J. 58: 134, 2013 (Bakalin 2013).
Note:—The senior author has chosen a new name for the species following ICN recommendation 23A.3(j) since the
species likely occurs beyond Camiguin Island.

Solenostoma inundatum var. grandirete
Bakalin (2013: 137) described a new variety and compared it with Solenostoma inundatum (Hooker f. &
Taylor 1844: 559) Stephani (1901: 490) and Solenostoma rufiflorum (Colenso 1886: 237) Engel (2007: 312).
Moreover, he wrote “The differentiating features may be regarded as induced by habitat conditions.”
However, the specimen is—according to the description and figures (Bakalin 2013: 135–137, fig. 6) fully
identical with Solenostoma orbiculatum, a species not mentioned or discussed by Bakalin in the text. All three
mentioned differences from Solenostoma inundatum var. inundatum, esp. larger midleaf cells, convex trigones
in the midleaf and strongly thickend external wall of the leaf margin, are typical for Solenostoma orbiculatum.
Also mostly brownish plants, suborbicular to reniform, decurrent leaves, fusiform to obpyriform perianths etc.
are typical for Solenostoma orbiculatum, not Solenostoma inundatum.
