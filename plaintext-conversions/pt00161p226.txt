Abstract
A new species of Cocconeis, C. tortilis, was found on some seaweed collected from the Izu and Okinawa Islands of
Japan. Its morphology was examined using both light and electron microscopy; details are described herein. This small
diatom is characterized by: 1) a concave raphid valve with a straight raphe inclined from the apical axis, central area
forming stauros, and uniseriate striae consisting of circular areolae occluded by hymens: 2) a twisted convex araphid
valve with a narrow lanceolate sternum inclined from the apical axis, and uniseriate striae consisting of several loculate
areolae occluded by hymens: and 3) a cingulum consisting of three non fimbriated girdle bands including a valvocopula.
Key words: Bacillariophyta, Cocconeis tortilis, Japan, marine diatom, new species

Introduction
This report is a continuation of our previous papers dealing with morphological and taxonomic investigations of
species in the genus Cocconeis (Ehrenberg 1837: 173; Nagumo & Kobayasi 1985, Suzuki et al. 2001). In the
present study, an unrecognized species of Cocconeis was found growing on seaweed (e.g. Codium intricatum
Okamura 1913: 74) and the seagrass Zostera japonica Ascheron & Graebner (1907: 32) from the coasts of Izu
Islands, Minami-Daito Island and Okinawa Islands, both affected by the Kuroshio Current. It has been named C.
tortilis Hide. Suzuki sp. nov. and is described using light (LM), scanning and transmission electron microscopy
(SEM and TEM); it is compared to similar taxa.

Material and methods
Samples were obtained from seaweeds and seagrass collected from the intertidal zone of the North Pacific coast of
Japan at the following localities (Fig. 1):
I. Tsuchikata beach (34°04’20”N, 139°28’41”E), Miyake Island, the Izu Islands, Tokyo, epiphytic on Codium
intricatum (Codiaceae, Ulvophyceae) collected by A. Takahashi on 3 July 2012, material and slide BM 101683 and
MTUF-AL-43010;
II. Shioma beach (33°04’06”N, 139°50’07”E), Hachijo Island, the Izu Islands, Tokyo, epiphytic on
Asparagopsis taxiformis (Delie) Trevisan (Bonnemaisoniaceae, Rhodophyceae) collected by A. Kobayashi on 28
June 2003, material MTUF-AL-43011;
III. Honba beach (25°52’19”N, 131°14’58”E), Minami-Daito Island, the Daito Islands, Okinawa Pref.,
epiphytic on Jania sp. (Corallinaceae, Rhodophyceae) collected by T. Nagumo on 17 Feb. 2004, material MTUFAL-43012;

seagrass Zostera japonica (Zosteraceae, Liliopsida) collected by Y. Mikame on 31 May 2010, material MTUF-AL43013; and
V. Shinri Beach (26°21’18”N, 126°42’50”E), Kume Island, the Okinawa Islands, Okinawa Pref., epiphytic on
Boodlea coacta (Dickie) G.Murray & De Toni (Boodleaceae, Ulvophyceae) collected by Y. Mikame on 31 May
2010, material MTUF-AL-43014.
Samples and type slides were deposited at BM (BM 101683) and the Algae Collections of the Museum of
Fishery Sciences, Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology, Japan (MTUF-AL-43010-43014).

FIGURE 1: Map of the 5 sampling sites in the North Pacific coast of Japan (arrows). Numbers (I–V) correspond to those in text.

All samples were fixed with 2.5 % glutaraldehyde solution.
The material was treated using the bleaching method described by Nagumo & Kobayasi (1990), Nagumo
(1995) and Osada & Nagumo (2001). Light and electron microscopy techniques are described in Nagumo &
Kobayasi (1985) and Suzuki et al. (2001). Prepared specimens were examined using HITACHI S-5000 SEM and
JEOL-2000EX TEM (The Nippon Dental University School of Life Dentistry at Tokyo) operating at 2kVand 80
kV, respectively.
The valves’ size was determined from measurements of 30 valves; striae density was measured in 15 valves
using TEM as the striae are difficult to observe accurately by LM.
The terminology for the parts of the valve and girdle follow Anonymous (1975), Ross et al. (1979) and Cox
(2012), with additional terms from Kobayasi et al. (2006).

The frustule is heterovalvate. The valve is small, elliptic to oval, and twisted (Figs 2–9), measuring 10.4–17.2 µm
in length, 7.2–11.6 µm in breadth. Striae densities at the centre of the valves are 33–45 in 10 µm for the raphid
valve (RV), 43–55 in 10 µm for the araphid valve (ARV). The RV is slightly concave (Fig. 12). The raphe is
straight, and inclined from the apical axis (Figs 2, 3, 6, 7). The inner raphe lie in a very narrow, but raised, axial
area (Fig. 13). The proximal raphe ends are coaxial and slightly-dilated externally (Fig. 15) but internally they are
undilated and deflected in opposite directions (Fig. 17). The distal raphe ends are elliptically-dilated externally
(Fig. 14) but, internally, terminate in short helictoglossae (Fig. 16, arrow). The central area is rhombic in shape
(Figs 6, 7) and extending laterally to the valve margin in one stria’s width (Figs 12, 13, 18, 19). This area is flat on
the outer surface (Figs 15, 18, 19) and slightly raised on the inner surface (Figs 13, 17), forming a stauros (Figs 18,
19, asterisks). The striae consist of small round areolae, and are radiate and uniseriate (Fig. 12). Each areola is
circular and occluded by a hymen with perforations arranged in a centric array (Figs 20, 21). A submarginal
hyaline area is not recognizable; a narrow marginal hyaline area is visible (Fig. 12). The terminal hyaline area is
small and elliptical, and extends to the marginal hyaline one (Figs 12, 14).

The ARV is convex (Fig. 22) and twisted (Figs 11, 34). The ARV (Fig. 23) is thicker than the RV (Fig. 13). The
sternum, inclined from the apical axis (Fig. 35, dashed line), is a narrow furrow on the outer surface (Fig. 22), and
narrow lanceolate internally (Figs 8, 9, 23). In some valves, a vestigial raphe is observed (Fig. 25, arrows). The

striae that consist of several loculate areolae (Fig. 24) are radiate and uniseriate (Fig. 22). Each areola is occluded
by a hymen located near the outer surface (Fig. 28, arrows), internally, opens by means of a circular to elliptic
foramen (Figs 23, 25). The perforations of the hymen are linear, oblique and arranged in a parallel array (Figs 26,
27).
The mature cingulum consists of three girdle bands (Figs 29, 30): a valvocopula and two bands (the second and
the third bands), which are both narrower and thinner than the valvocopula. The valvocopula of each valve is open
at one pole (Figs 31–33, arrows) and has no fimbriae and areolae; their inner edges are smooth (Figs 31, 33). The
second band, adjacent to the valvocopula, is open at the opposite pole (Fig. 30) and possesses a ligula (Fig. 29).
The third band is also open (Fig. 29). The valvocopula of each valve is open at a place slightly shifted from one
distal end of the raphe or sternum (Figs 31–35, arrows). This is similar to the second and third bands; the
disordered of arrangement of striae, known as the “Voigt fault” (Voigt 1956) can be observed here (Figs 29, 30,
arrows).
Etymology:—From the Latin tortilis (twisted), referring to the twisted appearance of the valve plane.
Distribution and ecology:—Cocconeis tortilis has been found in the Izu, Daito, and Okinawa Islands affected
by the Kuroshio Current, which is a north-flowing warm ocean current on the west side of the North Pacific Ocean,
and grows abundantly on the spherical utricles of Codium intricatum in Miyake Island, Japan (Fig. 10, arrowheads)
and on the fine branches of Asparagopsis taxiformis in Hachijo Island, Japan (Fig. 11).
Observations:—Cocconeis tortilis has the following characteristics of the genus (after Round et al. 1990):
1) heterovalvar; one valve (RV) with a raphe, the other (ARV) without;
2) valves elliptical or almost circular;
3) RV concave with a correspondingly convex ARV;
4) areolae occluded by hymens with linear perforations;
5) terminal raphe endings without fissures;
6) central raphe endings externally simple or slightly expanded, internally deflected towards opposite sides; and
7) cingulum consisting of a few narrow, non-areolae bands.
Our study suggests that C. tortilis is most similar to C. molesta Kützing var. crucifera Grunow (in Van Heurck
1880–1885: pl. 30, figs 20–23; Kobayasi & Nagumo 1985, De Stefano et al. 2000), C. dirupta Gregory (1857: 491;
Kobayasi & Nagumo 1985), and C. convexa Giffen (1967: 257; Suzuki et al. 2001, De Stefano & Romero 2005),
but can be distinguished from each other by several characters (listed in Table 1).

Cocconeis tortilis has the following unique characters:
1. The ARV plane is twisted; and
2. the raphe in the RV and the sternum in the ARV are inclined from the apical axes.

the outer surface.

These characters have not been observed in any other species of Cocconeis, and are thus diagnostic for
Cocconeis tortilis. C. tortilis can be readily distinguished from C. molesta var. crucifera in having a central area not
forming stauros in the RV, in having an areola occluded by two ‘horseshoe shaped’ hymens and a linear sternum of
ARV and in having a lower density of the striae on both valves (30, 28–30 in 10 µm on the RV, 38, 35–37 in 10 µm
on the ARV; Kobayasi & Nagumo 1985, De Stefano et al. 2000, respectively); it can be distinguished from C.
