Abstract
A new species of Flacourtia from Yingjiang, SW Yunnan, China, bordering with Burma, is described and illustrated.
Flacourtia turbinata is similar to F. jangomas in leaf and flower shape, but can be easily distinguished for its triplinerved
leaf venation, extraordinary long sepals, turbinate fruit and pubescent leaves and twigs when young.

Introduction
The genus Flacourtia Comm. ex L’Héritier (1786: 59) is the type of Flacourtieae (previously placed in
Flacourtiaceae, now Salicaceae) (Leskinen & Alström-Rapaport 1999, Chase 2002, Angiosperm Phylogeny
Group 2009, Reveal & Chase 2011). It consists of 15 to 17 species, distributed in tropical Asia and Africa.
There are 5 species in China with one endemic, 4 of them extending to Yunnan (Yang & Zmarzty 2007). There
were 8 species recorded for British India (Hooker & Thomson 1872), 7 species for British Burma (Kurz
1877), and there are as many as 79 names of Flacourtia listed in the PlantList, only 8 of them currently
accepted (The Plant List 2010), but no modern systematic study on this genus has been published so far.
Based on the coalition of styles and presence or absence of the ridges on the fruit, Chinese Flacourtia have
been divided into two sections: sect. Connatistylatae Fan & Xu (1988: 131) and sect. Flacourtia.
In April 2007, some specimens were collected by the authors during an exploration of Yingjiang, SW
Yunnan. The flowering specimens of Flacourtia aroused our interest. In July 2012, we investigated the same
place again, and this time fruiting specimens were obtained. After consulting relevant literature (Hooker &
Thomson 1872, Kurz 1877, Lai 1999, Yang & Zmarzty 2007), we concluded that it is a separate species new
to science, and should be placed in sect. Connatistylatae.

Taxonomy
Flacourtia turbinata H. J. Dong & H. Peng, sp. nov. (Figures 1 & 2)
It differs from F. jangomas in the triplinerved leaf venation, extraordinary long sepals, turbinate fruits, and leaves and
twigs with pubescence when young.
Type:—CHINA. Yunnan: Yingjiang county, Tongbiguan village, elevation ca. 1100 m, 7 July 2012 (fr), Peng Hua &
Dong Hongjin 2813 (holotype KUN!, isotype KUN!).

Rampant shrub, 1–1.5 m tall, deciduous; branches usually armed with tortuous spines; bark yellow-brown or
light brown, young branches green, smooth, sparsely pubescent, and later glabrescent. Petiole 3–6 mm long,
pubescent or glabrescent; leaf blade thinly leathery to papery, narrowly ovate, ovate-elliptic, or ovate-oblong,

rarely oblong-lanceolate or obovate-lanceolate, 8–15 × 4–6 cm, acute or rounded at base, margin serrate, longcaudate-acuminate at apex, glabrous abaxially, pubescent abaxially when young, then turning glabrous when
fruiting; venation triplinerved, slightly raised on both surfaces, secondary veins conspicuous on both surfaces.
Inflorescences axillary, solitary, peduncles 1–2 cm long, puberulous; bracts linear, ca. 1 × 5 mm, outside
glabrous or sparsely hairy, inside pubescent, margin entire, ciliate. Flowers appearing with young leaves,
white to flavescent, honey-scented. Sepals 8 or 10, coalescent as a tube, dropped together, ca. 1 cm long and 1
cm in diameter, apex obtuse, outside pubescent. Staminate flowers unknown. Pistillate flowers: ovary coneshaped, 4 × 3 mm; styles 4–6, united into a distinct column, ca. 2 mm long, slightly free at their apices;
stigmas 2-lobed, dilated, recurved. Fruit green, turbinate, 2–2.5 cm in diameter, characteristically
longitudinally angled especially when dried, style column persistent. Seeds 14–16, spindly.

top-right corner, (E) lower side of branch showing the tortuous thorns.

Distribution:—Narrowly endemic in China and only known from the type locality, i.e. Tongbiguan
village (24°37 N, 97°25 E), ca. 65 km west of Yingjiang county (Figure 3).
Habitat & Ecology:—Flacourtia turbinata is locally common, growing in the margin of mountain
rainforests, accompanied by Ficus cyrtophylla (Wall. ex Miq.) Miq., Lindera nacusua (D.Don) Merr., Leea
macrophylla Roxb. ex Hornem., Gomphostemma arbusculum C.Y. Wu, Ageratina adenophora (Spreng.)
R.M. King & H. Rob., etc. Elevation varies from 1100 m to 1300 m, the average annual temperature of
Yingjiang County is 19.3 °C, the average annual precipitation is ca. 2600 mm.
Etymology:—The species is named for the unusual fruit shape.
Phenology:—Flowering from March to May, fruiting from June to August.
Additional collection (paratype):—CHINA. Yunnan: Yingjiang county, Tongbiguan village, elevation
ca. 1100 m, 18 April 2007 (fl), Liu Ende 1897 (KUN!).

Similar species:—Flacourtia turbinata is morphologically close to F. jangomas (Loureiro 1790: 634)
Raeuschel (1797: 290), distributed in W Guangxi, S Hainan and S Yunnan, based on united stigma and the
leaf shape, but it could easily be distinguished by several other characters (Table 1).
