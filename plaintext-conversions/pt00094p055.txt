Abstract
This paper describes and illustrates a new Philodendron subgenus Pteromischum species from Espírito Santo State, in
Southeastern Brazil, including information on its conservation in a high priority area for conservation of the Atlantic
Forest. The work also includes a key to the Brazilian Atlantic Forest species of the subgenus.
Key words: aroids, endemism, humid flora, taxonomy

Introduction
Philodendron Schott (1829: 780) is the second largest genus of Araceae, being exclusively Neotropical with
ca. 480 published species and ca. 700 estimated (Boyce & Croat 2012). In Brazil it has ca. 165 species
(Sakuragui et al. 2012) in several biomes, especially in Amazonian and Atlantic rainforests, with 59% and
39% of the diversity respectively (Sakuragui et. al. 2012). The infrageneric classification into three subgenera
is widely accepted: Philodendron (80% of the species), Pteromischum (Schott 1856: 77) Mayo (1989: 168)
(15% of the species) and Meconostigma (Schott 1832: 20) Engler (1899: 554) (5% of the species).
The species of the subgenus Pteromischum, originally a section of subgenus Euphilodendron Engler
(1899: 510) (e.g. in Krause 1913), can be morphologically characterized by the well-developed foliar sheath
and anisophyllous sympodial growth, bearing many leaves per article (Grayum 1996). Mayo (1989), based on
anatomical investigations, elevated Pteromischum to the status of subgenus, a decision that was later
supported by a molecular phylogenetic study (Gauthier et al. 2008), which indicated that the other two
subgenera were also monophyletic.
Philodendron subg. Pteromischum has two centers of diversity, one in Central America and another in
West Amazonia (Grayum 1996), but is poorly represented in extra-Amazonian South America. Grayum’s
(1996) detailed revision of species occurring in Central America and the Pacific Coast of South America is the
only modern study of the group. However, in that work, most Brazilian species were not discussed.
Here we describe Philodendron rhodospermum sp. nov. and propose an updated key to Brazilian species
of the subgenus from the Atlantic Forest.

Methods
During field expeditions and a visit to the MBML herbarium, in Espírito Santo State, we found an unidentified
specimen of Philodendron subgenus Pteromischum from Reserva Biológica Augusto Ruschi (REBIO
Augusto Ruschi). To provide a more detailed description of the species and its habitat, the first author visited

the area during the plant´s fertile period and collected fresh material. A taxonomic analysis of the specimen
revealed that it belonged to a new species, which is described here.
The descriptive terminology follows Stearn (2004) and Mayo (1991). The new species was compared
with the type of species morphologically similar to the collected material, as well as to the descriptions in
works including species of Philodendron subg. Pteromischum (e.g. Grayum 1996, Krause 1913). The key is
based on the original descriptions of species.

Taxonomy
Philodendron rhodospermum Calazans & Sakur., sp. nov. (Figures 1, 2)
Philodendron rhodospermum is most similar to Philodendron propinquum Schott (1856: 78), but the former has broader
ovate leaves, sometimes slightly asymmetric, fewer primary lateral veins (3–5 pairs), lamina notable thinner
with secondary lateral veins prominent in dry material, and reddish seeds.
Type:—BRAZIL. Espírito Santo: Santa Teresa, Reserva Biológica Augusto Ruschi, road to Goiapaba-açu, 19° 54’ 26.7”
S, 40° 32’ 53.7” W, 24 November 2012, L.S.B. Calazans & R.T. Valadares 213 (holotype: RB!; isotypes: CEPEC!,
K!).

Herb perennial, hemiepiphytic near the ground. Stem branched; internodes 1.5–5.5(–7.5) cm long, cylindrical,
dark green to brownish, matte, drying paler brown, epidermis vertically cracked; flagellar shoots present.
Petiole 11.6–16.7 × 1.0–1.5 cm, sheath 11.0–15.6 × 1.0–1.5 cm, horizontally splayed, glossy green, apical
ligule 0.6–1.1 cm long, acute to narrowly rounded, slightly unequal, unsheathed portion of petiole 0.3–1.5 cm
long, adaxially flattened, abaxially rounded; leaf blade 13.0–22.0 × (5.0–)7.5–13.5 cm, often pendulous from
the petiole apex, elliptic to broadly ovate, sometimes slightly asymmetric, apex acuminate to cuspidate,
margin entire, base rounded to subcordate, smooth, glossy green on both faces, drying membranaceous to
subchartaceous , striated, olive-green to brownish; midrib and primary lateral veins adaxially sunken,
abaxially raised, primary lateral veins 3–5 pairs, arising at (30–)45–60º angle from midrib, arcuate to margin,
drying prominent and greenish-yellow abaxially, secondary veins discrete, parallel to primary veins,
numerous, drying prominent on both surfaces. Inflorescence solitary; peduncle 2.0–4.5 cm long, cylindrical,
striated; spathe 6.0–9.0 cm long, ovate, acuminate (the acumen ca. 1.0 cm long), constriction not evident,
externally pale yellow, becoming green in fruit, internally cream, resin canals internally visible; stipe of
spadix up to 1.5 cm long; spadix 5.1–6.2(–7.2) cm long, slender; fertile male zone 2.8–3.4 cm long, not
obviously exerted in fruit; intermediate sterile zone 0.4–0.55 cm long; female zone 1.7–2.0 cm long; stamens
ca. 1.0 mm long, in groups of 4–6, prismatic; intermediate staminodes ca. 1.5 mm long, clavate; gynoecium
1.0–2.0 mm long, ovary flask-shaped, slightly broader than style, 2–3(–4)-locular, multi-ovulated,
placentation axile. Juvenile berries pale green. Seeds ca. 1 mm long, fusiform, slightly curved, longitudinally
striated, reddish-pink, drying purplish-red to brownish.
Phenology:—Collected in flower from September to November and in fruit from September to January.
Etymology:—The specific epithet alludes to the remarkable reddish-pink coloration of the seeds (Figure
2b–c), a very useful character for field identification.
Distribution and habitat:—Known only from two localities in the Espírito Santo State, Atlantic Forest;
600–850 m elevation. Almost all collections are from REBIO Augusto Ruschi, municipality of Santa Teresa,
where the species is common and can be easily found on the edge of the trails. Until now, only one collection
outside this area is known, at Pedra de Santa Luzia, municipality of Governador Lindenberg, ca. 70 km distant
from Santa Teresa. Both localities are situated in an extension of the Serra da Mantiqueira, suggesting a
possible broader area of occurrence along this mountain region.

Conservation:—Collections made so far are located in remnants of Atlantic Forest (Figure 3). The
fragment at Santa Teresa, in the southern part of Espírito Santo State, is extensive and includes a Federal
Conservation Unit (REBIO Augusto Ruschi), which ensures some protection for the species. Moreover, there
are contiguous protected fragments in the region, such as the Parque Natural Municipal de São Lourenço.
The fragment located at Governador Lindenberg is extremely small and is located outside the
conservation area, however it is in an area of high priority for conservation, according to Brazilian federal law
(Brasil 2007) (Figure 3). Furthermore, according to the laws of Espírito Santo State (Brasil 2011), this
fragment is also inserted in a priority area for conservation of Atlantic Forest named Marilândia, which is
important for harbouring threatened and endemic species as well as possible taxa new to science. It also
consists of a large area of unprotected fragments that contribute to the connectivity of other priority areas for
conservation. Official guidelines for the area include biological inventories of fauna and flora, diagnosis of
forest fragments and the creation of new protected areas. The presence of this new Philodendron in the area
highlights the importance and urgency of these conservation actions in the state.
Due to the lack of ecological data and records we are unable to suggest a conservation status for the
species at this moment, which should remain as data deficient for conservation purposes.

Additional examined material:—BRAZIL. Espírito Santo: Governador Lindenberg, Pedra de Santa
Luzia, 19° 17’ 17” S, 40° 27’ 56” W, 07 November 2007, V. Demuner et al. 4483 (MBML!); Santa Teresa,
Reserva Biológica Augusto Ruschi, 19 September 2001, L. Kollmann et al. 4684 (MBML!).
Affinities:—According to Grayum’s concepts (1996) of sections in subgenus Pteromischum,
Philodendron rhodospermum belongs to section Fruticosa Grayum (1996: 117), displaying proleptic growth,
stem branched and shrubby, lack of nodal anchor roots, extensive sheath and solitary inflorescences lacking
cataphylls. It is similar to P. propinquum Schott (1856: 78), differing by its broader ovate leaves, often
pendulous leaf blade (i.e. the acute angle between petiole and lamina), fewer primary lateral veins and reddish
seeds (vs. oblong or ovate-oblong leaves, often erect leaf blade, 5–7 primary lateral veins and pale brown
seeds). In dry material of P. rhodospermum the leaves are notable thinner and the numerous secondary lateral
veins become prominent, providing a striated appearance to the lamina, which is also useful in separating
these species.
The new species resembles P. romeroi Grayum (1996: 70), an endemic species of Sierra Nevada de Santa
Marta, Colombia. This latter can be distinguished by its appressed climbing habit, larger leaves, stout
inflorescences and granular abaxial surface on dry leaves, being a member of section Pteromischum (Schott
1856: 77) Engler (1878: 133). Although the previously listed characters indicate the inclusion of P.
rhodospermum in section Fruticosa, its similarity with a member of another section emphasizes the
complexity involving classification below subgenus level in Pteromischum, as in the whole genus.
