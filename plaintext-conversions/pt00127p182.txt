Abstract
A pivotal component of hydrological restoration of the Florida Everglades is the improvement of water conveyance to
Everglades National Park by the degradation of the current network of canals, roadways and levees. The Tamiami Trail
(L29) road/canal complex represents a major barrier to natural water flows into the park and a variety of modification
options for flow improvement are currently being explored, including the installation of spreader swales immediately
downstream of culverts conveying water under Tamiami Trail from the L29 canal into Everglades National Park. In this
study, we evaluated water column chemistry and wet-season diatom community structure to provide baseline
information for use in future monitoring activities related to the proposed Tamiami Trail modifications. Water chemistry
showed pronounced fluctuations in response to precipitation and anthropogenically mediated hydrological events.
Differences in water quality variables among sites were dampened during periods of inundation, and became more
pronounced during periods of low canal stage, suggesting the importance of small-scale mechanisms related to isolation
of habitat patches. Diatom assemblages were unexpectedly speciose (127 taxa in 40 samples) compared to typical
Everglades assemblages, and spatially heterogeneous in sites associated with concentric areas of dense vegetation
immediately downstream of culverts. We also observed significant compositional dissimilarities among transects,
indicating that culvert pool and north transect assemblages were substantially influenced by propagule input from the
canal and areas to the north, while south transect sites were compositionally similar to typical sawgrass prairie diatom
communities. Central transect sites were compositionally intermediate to their north and south counterparts. We propose
that the position and spatial extent of this “transitional assemblage” is a sensitive indicator of subtle environmental
change related to Tamiami Trail modifications.

Introduction
The Florida Everglades represent the largest subtropical wetland complex in North America, and also is one of
the largest karstic wetland systems in the world (Noe et al. 2001, LeHee 2010, Richardson 2010, Lodge 2010,
Gaiser et al. 2011). Historically, the greater Everglades ecosystem was comprised of a hydrologically
continuous network of lakes, rivers and marshes extending from the Kissimmee Lakes in central Florida to the
shores of Florida Bay. Until the early 20th century, the Everglades were viewed as a vast, inhospitable swamp,
the last refuge of the Miccosukee and Seminole Indians and largely not worth further exploration (Blake 1980,
Richardson 2008). During the 20th Century, a wide variety of efforts were made to tame the Everglades for
agricultural and urban development (Hollander 2008, Richardson 2010). The result has been the creation of a
network of canals, levees and flow control structures that now impede natural water flows theoughout South
Florida.

Waters that once would have flowed unimpeded from their headwaters near the Kissimmee Lakes through
the Kissimmee River into Lake Okeechobee, and then overland through a variety of wetlands into what is now
Everglades National Park (ENP; Steinman et al. 2002, Richardson 2010) now face a myriad of diversions and
obstacles (SFWMD 1998). The impacts of impeded water conveyance in the Everglades are now blatantly
apparent (Sklar et al. 2001). Shortened hydroperiods in the central Everglades sawgrass prairie have led to
changes in the distribution and dynamics of plant communities and associated highly endemic periphyton
assemblages (Slate and Stevenson 2000, Gottlieb et al. 2005, Saunders et al. 2006). In addition, elevated
phosphorus inputs from canal point sources have impacted algal and plant communities both within the park
and in the water conservation areas (WCA) to the north (Rashke 1993, McCormick & O’Dell 1996, Gaiser et
al. 2006a, McCormick et al. 2009). Further south, seawater encroachment has elongated the mangrove
ecotone between the freshwater and marine systems (Ross et al. 2000, 2001, Stewart et al. 2002, Gaiser et al.
2006b).
In response to the growing list of impacts to the Florida Everglades, several initiatives have been
developed with the objective of preserving the system, and ultimately restoring it to a more “natural” state
(Noe et al. 2001, Sklar et al. 2005). The most recent, and farthest reaching of these plans is the
Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP), which aims in part to restore natural waterflows within
the Everglades by degrading levees, infilling canals and bridging major roadways (RECOVER 2005). Of
these roadways, the Tamiami Trail, a 160 km east-west section of US Highway 41 between Miami and
Naples, FL is regarded as the lynchpin of the CERP plan. With only 55 culverts and four major flow control
structures to convey water to the southern Everglades along its length, the road and the associated L29 canal
act as a major dam and diversion to north-south flows. The modification of Tamiami Trail has been called "the
Grand Experiment" by many stakeholders, and several options for maintaining improved water conveyance
under the roadway are now being considered within CERP.
One option that has been proposed to increase water flow into the southern Everglades is the construction
of swales or spreader canals downstream of culverts in order to diffuse point-source culvert discharge and
approximate sheet flow into ENP. The proposed Tamiami swales will be installed 8 m downstream (south) of
the Tamiami Trail right of way (Fig. 2). They will be 330 m in length and 10 m in width, with depths
determined by the bedrock boundary. Installation of these structures is not without inherent risks. Anticipated
impacts of swale creation include increased water column turbidity and total suspended solids due to
construction activity, increased pollutant loading and enhanced downstream transport of pollutants into ENP,
and the downstream extension of the dense vegetation halos that currently surround culvert pools. We
speculate that these halos have developed in response to enhanced point-source phosphorus inputs at the
culvert outflows. This initial contribution incorporates a subset of data from a larger pilot project currently
being undertaken in order to assess the effects of swale construction on water quality and biological integrity
in the area adjacent to the Tamiami Trail culverts.
Here, we examine the spatial and temporal variability of background water quality and wet-season diatom
community structure prior to installation of spreader swales at pilot culverts. We test the null hypotheses that
water chemistry does not differ significantly among transects or among monthly sampling events. We also
evaluate the null hypotheses that diatom taxonomic richness and diversity do not differ significantly among
transects and that no significant dissimilarity exists among diatom assemblages from different transects.
Furthermore, we provide a synopsis of diatom taxa typically encountered at each transect as a baseline for
future monitoring efforts.
Due to their widespread distribution in aqueous environments and their ability to respond sensitively and
quickly to environmental gradients, diatoms have been well established as ideal organisms for use in
biological assessment (Lange-Bertalot 1979, LeClercq 1988, Round 1991, Dixit & Smol 1993). In the
Everglades, diatoms have been shown to respond to several environmental gradients including phosphorus
(Rashcke 1993, Gaiser et al. 2006) and other nutrients and ions (Cooper et al. 1999, Hagerthey et al. 2011,
Gaiser et al. 2011). Where they are well-preserved in sediment records, diatoms and other siliceous
microfossils have also been used as indicators of environmental change within the freshwater Everglades

(Slate & Stevenson 2000, Winkler et al. 2001). As in other aquatic systems, diatoms can be found
ubiquitously throughout the Everglades. Species assemblages, however, shift with changing landscapes. The
culvert sites are located in the Northeast Shark slough, a typical ridge and slough type habitat where the
characteristic diatom assemblage commonly includes Brachysira neoexilis Lange-Bertalot in Lange-Bertalot
& G. Moser (1994: 51-54), Cyclotella meneghiniana Kützing (1844: 50), Encyonema evergladianum
Krammer (1997: 193), Mastogloia smithii Thwaites ex W. Smith (1856: 65) (we now call this Mastogloia cf.
lacustris (Grunow) Van Heurck (1880: pl. 4, fig. 14)) and Nitzschia palea var. debilis (Kützing) Grunow in
Cleve & Grunow (1880: 96) (Gaiser et al. 2011). We expect to encounter these taxa within the southernmost
transects of our sites, and assemblages more consistent with the central Everglades habitats of the water
conservation areas in closer proximity to the culverts themselves. Childers et al. (2003) asserted that waters
flowing into Everglades wetlands from canals or agricultural areas were significantly enriched in phosphorus,
but waters within the Everglades typically exhibited very low phosphorus concentrations. We expect our
results to follow this trend, with phosphorus levels decreasing downstream with distance from the canal.

Methods
Site description and sampling.
Tamiami Trail forms the northern boundary of Everglades National Park. Four culverts passing under the road
in Northeast Shark Slough (C43, C44, C47, C51, Fig. 1) were selected by the National Park Service for
inclusion in the pilot swales study. Each culvert consists of three 1 m concrete tubes crossing under the road,
and conveying water from the L29 canal. Immediately downstream of each culvert is an outflow scour pool
approximately 1 m deep and 15 m across. A halo of dense vegetation comprised largely of pond apple
(Annona glabra L.), coastal plain willow (Salix caroliniana Michx.) and leather fern (Acrostichum
danaeifolium (Langsd.) Fisch.) surrounds the culvert pool concentrically and extends south for approximately
100 m. Beyond the tree halo is a transitional area dominated by S. caroliniana and cattail (Typha domingensis
Pers.), which extends south for another 100 m, where it is replaced by the sawgrass prairie dominated by
Cladium jamaicense (Crantz) Britt., typical of the southern Everglades. Southern sites were also characterized
by extensive periphyton mats composed of a mixture of benthic algae, bacteria, fungi and detritus. These mats
are typical of the ridge and slough portions of the Everglades.
At each culvert, we created three east-west transects (north, central and south), with three sites per
transect (west, central and east Fig. 2). North transect sites were situated within the vegetation halo
approximately 40 m south of the Tamiami Trail right of way. Central transect sites were located directly south
of their northern transect counterparts, and positioned latitudinally to ensure that they were situated within the
transitional area. Similarly, south transect sites were located due south of their northern and central
counterparts, and placed within the sawgrass prairie. The locations of sites were selected to maximize the
macrohabitat and vascular plant assemblage similarity of sites within each transect across culverts. We also
created three canal sites immediately upstream of each culvert for a total of 12 grab sample sites per culvert.
In addition to the transect sites, ISCO Model 6712 Portable Samplers were deployed at the downstream extent
of each culvert site, just south of the south central station, in order to continuously monitor the quality of the
water flowing through study sites.
Filtered (0.5 µm nitrocellulose) and unfiltered water grab samples were taken monthly at each of the 36
transect sites between December 2009and April 2010. Additionally, triplicate filtered and unfiltered samples
were taken from the Tamiami Canal immediately upstream of each culvert as a control. ISCO autosamplers
were programmed to sample 250 mL of water every 18 h in order to compile 1 L composite samples every 3
days between October 2009 and April 2010.
Diatom material was collected by removing material to fill a 20 mL scintillation vial from every available
substrate type at each site, as well as from substrates within the culvert pools. At north and central sites,
floating periphyton, benthos, woody debris and moss were often sampled, while at south sites substrata were

primarily limited to benthos and periphyton mats. Diatom sampling took place in November 2009, during a
period of relative climatic stability at the end of the 2009 wet season and prior to any potentially disruptive
activity within the sites.

Water Quality Analysis
Unfiltered water grab samples and ISCO autosampler water samples were analyzed for total nitrogen (TN)
and total phosphorous (TP), while filtered water grab samples were analyzed for Nitrate/Nitrite (N/N)
Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC), Ammonia (NH 3 ), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). Total
phosphorus was determined following EPA method 365.1, with modified sample preparation methods
described by Solózano & Sharp (1980). Inorganic nutrient analyses (TN, NO 2 , NO 3 , NH 3 , SRP) were
performed by simultaneous wet chemical analysis using a four-channel Alpkem RFA-300 Rapid Flow
Analyzer according to EPA methods 353.2 (N+N, NO2), 350.1 (NH4) and 365.1 (SRP).
Diatom Enumeration
Composite samples were created for each site by combining 5 mL of sample slurry from each substrate within
the site. Diatom material was cleaned using a hot nitric / sulphuric acid digestion and subsequently subjected
to five cycles of distilled water rinsing and centrifugation. Cleaned diatom material was dried onto coverslips
and mounted to light microscope (LM) slides with Naphrax® high resolution mountant from Borael Sciences
Ltd.. Diatom valves were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level (species or lower) and counted
within random fields of view on each slide until either the end of the field of view in which the 200th valve of
the most abundant taxon was encountered, or until the end of the 20th field of view. This technique typically

Statistical Analysis
Water quality data were normalized and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) and a Two-way
Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) were used to explore patterns of similarity among water samples by
transect (canal, north, central, south) and by sampling event (Dec. 2009 - Apr. 2010), with Euclidean distance
as the similarity matrix metric. In addition, Multivariate Dispersion Analysis (MVDISP) was used to examine
cohesiveness of sample groups. Analyses were carried out using PRIMER 6 software. Diatom count data were
used to calculate species richness (r) and Shannon's Index (H') (Shannon 1948) for each station. A series of
One-way Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) with post-hoc Bonferroni testing were used to evaluate differences
in mean r and H' among transects (pool, north, central, south) using the SPSS 16 statistical package. Further
NMDS, MVDISP and ANOSIM analyses were used to examine patterns of diatom assemblage similarity
among transects, using a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix.

Results
Water Quality
A total of 241 composite water samples were taken by the ISCO autosamplers between October 23, 2009 and
April 9, 2010. Total Nitrogen values ranged from 31.22 µmol · L-1 (C47 Dec. 5, 2009) to 190.49 µmol · L-1
(C43 Mar. 13, 2010) and TP ranged from 0.03 µmol · L-1 (C47 Apr. 3 2010) to 1.69 µmol · L-1 (C44 Feb. 20,
2010). Between late October and mid-December, 2009, TN fluctuated around a mean of 50 µmol · L-1 with
strong concordance among autosampler sites (Fig. 3a). In December 2009, TN levels rose across by about 50
µmol · L-1 at all culverts, and temporal fluctuations in TN values became more pronounced until a return to
pre-December levels in late January 2010. This period corresponded to a drop in water levels as indicated by
L29 canal stage measurements reported by the South Florida Water Management District (Fig. 3c). Despite
fluctuations at all sites, a coarse temporal congruence was maintained until a period of high-stage water
fluctuations beginning in March 2010. Total phosphorus remained low (< 0.40 µmol · L-1) across all sites
throughout the sampling period. Some brief fluctuations occurred late in the sampling period concurrently
with the high-stage water level fluctuation mentioned above.

A total of 214 filtered and 214 unfiltered water grab samples were taken between December 2009 and
April 2010. Total Nitrogen ranged from 26.06 µmol · L-1 (C44SW Feb 2010) to 162.23 µmol · L -1 (C44NW
Apr. 2010, Fig. 4a). Total phosphorus values from the same samples ranged from 0.11 µmol · L-1 (C51SE Feb.
2010) to 3.88 µmol · L-1 (C43NC Dec. 2009, Fig. 4b). Water quality variables were broadly homogeneous
across sites, with increased TP being consistently observed closer to the park boundary (canal and north
transect samples). A summary of water quality characteristics is provided in Table 1. NMDS ordination of
water samples based on all measured water quality parameters at all sites showed a general interspersion of all
groups (Fig. 5) and a One-way ANOSIM demonstrated that there were no significant dissimilarities among
water quality grab samples from culvert to culvert (Global R = -0.008, p > 0.05). This result indicates that the

four culverts chosen were appropriate replicates from a water quality standpoint. Multivariate Dispersion
Analysis (MVDISP) showed that the south transect samples represented the most spatially cohesive transect
group among culvert sites (dispersion = 0.812) followed by the central transect sites (dispersion = 0.888) In
NMDS, the southern transect sites clustered centrally on both axes, with some January samples clustered
outside the main group. Conversely, the north transect samples were the most widely scattered spatial group
(dispersion = 1.235). Within the north, central and south transects, samples clustered roughly according to

sampling month. Temporally, the samples taken during the December 2009 and January 2010 sampling events
represented the most heterogeneous groups (MVDISP, December dispersion = 1.438 January dispersion =
1.332), while samples taken during the February, March and April 2010 sampling events were more
homogeneously clustered (dispersion = 1.153, 0.708, 0.589, respectively). ANOSIM analyses showed that
both transect (Global R = 0.146, p < 0.001) and sampling event (Global R = 0.436, P < 0.001) exerted
significant effects on water sample similarity. Further pairwise Bonferroni tests demonstrated that samples
within each transect differed significantly from those within all other transects (0.075 < R < 0.239, p < 0.002,
Table 2a) with the exception that the south transect samples were not distinguishable from the canal samples
(R = 0.260, p = 0.10, Table 2a). Similarly, samples taken within each sampling event differed significantly
from those within all other sampling periods (0.146 < R < 0.534, p < 0.001, Table 2b).

Diatom Community Characteristics
We encountered 127 diatom taxa (Table 4) in the 40 composite samples from the swales study area. Culvert
pool sites exhibited visible diatom films upon sampling and were dominated numerically by an unnamed
Achnanthes (Achnanthes ftsp. 13), Encyonema evergladianum, and Nitzschia amphibia var. amphibia Grunow
(1862: 574). North transect sites typically supported sparse diatom communities with thin films comprised
primarily of Achnanthes ftsp. 13, Eunotia ftsp. 09, Eunotia ftsp. 10 and N. amphibia var. amphibia. Diatom
communities of the central sites were characterized by denser biofilms than north transect sites and were
dominated by Eunotia monodon Ehrenberg (1843: pl. 2/5, fig. 7), Fragilaria synegrotesca Lange-Bertalot
(1993: 49-50), Mastogloia smithii and Nitzschia semirobusta Lange-Bertalot (1993: 149-150). Southern
transect sites frequently supported very dense periphyton mats containing profuse diatom communities, and
counts of over 100 valves per field of view were not uncommon. These communities consisted almost
exclusively of M. smithii. Encyonema evergladianum and F. synegrotesca were the secondarily dominant taxa
in these assemblages.
Taxonomic richness (r) ranged from 8 (C44 SC) to 38 (C51 NW) and mean r differed significantly among
transects (Table 3, one-way ANOVA, F = 15.96, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Bonferroni testing demonstrated the
south transect sites to be significantly less rich than the north and central sites (North-south Mean Difference
= 15.175, p < 0.001; Central-south Mean Difference = 15.674, p < 0.01, Fig. 6a). Shannon's Index ranged
from 0.40 (C44 SC) to 3.01 (C43 CE) and similarly to taxonomic richness, differed significantly among
transects (Table 3, One-way ANOVA, F = 17.77, p < 0.001). Mean H' was significantly less at the south
transect sites that at all other transects (Pool-south Mean Difference = 0.880, p = 0.028, North-south Mean
Difference = 1.474, p < 0.001; Central-south Mean Difference = 1.081, p < 0.001; Fig. 6b).
An NMDS ordination conducted to illustrate differences between diatom assemblage structure at transect
sites showed pool sites largely interspersed with north transect sites (Fig. 7). Central transect sites clustered
intermediately to north and south transect sites, and south transect sites formed a tight cluster with only minor
overlap with a few central transect sites. Subsequent ANOSIM analysis of the same data revealed significant
dissimilarities among transects (Global R = 0.557, p < 0.001). Post-hoc Bonferroni tests illustrated that pool
sites were significantly dissimilar to central and south transect sites (Pool-central R = 0.41, p = 0.009; Poolsouth R = 0.98, p < 0.001). North transect sites were also significantly dissimilar to central and south transect
sites (North-central R = 0.25, p = 0.002; North-south R = 0.945, p < 0.001), and central transect sites were
significantly dissimilar to south transect sites (R = 0.402, p = 0.003). Despite the significant dissimilarities

among transects, NMDS ordination shows central sites as being modestly interspersed with both north and
south transect sites. MVDISP analysis revealed that the diatom assemblages of the South transect sites were
the most cohesive (dispersion = 0.464), while north and central sites were the most heterogenous (dispersion =
1.138 and 1.308, respectively).

Discussion
As efforts to restore the Florida Everglades to a more natural flow regime progress, Tamiami Trail and the
associated L29 canal pose a major obstacle to improved water conveyance into the southern Everglades.
Several alternatives have been proposed with the aim of overcoming this obstacle, including the installation of
spreader swales immediately downstream of culverts under the road right of way. The objective of this study
was to provide pre-impact water quality and wet-season diatom community data to be used as a baseline for
monitoring efforts post-swale installation and to assess the viability of diatoms as an assessment tool for
future monitoring.
Our results demonstrated that the water quality characteristics of the northern portion of Everglades
National Park can exhibit substantial spatial and temporal variability, which may be regulated both directly
and indirectly by stage in the Tamiami Canal. Water column TP remained consistently low (~ 0.40 µmol · L-1)
across all sites, and showed little variability in time or space. These results are consistent with Gaiser et al.
(2006a; 0.36 µmol · L-1 < TP < 3.6 µmol · L-1 for WCAs and ENP) and Childers et al. (2003; ~ 0.3 µmol · L-1)
and support assertions that periphyton TP is a better indicator of phosphorus loading and fate in the
Everglades than water column TP (Gaiser et al. 2004). Water column TN, on the other hand, exhibited
substantial temporal and spatial diversity, which often was driven by fluctuations in precipitation or Tamiami
Canal stage. TN concentrations from the ISCO samples almost tripled during a period of low stage in the L29
canal in December 2009 and January 2010. Water quality at grab sample sites also showed its greatest spatial
variability during the low stage period as indicated by MVDISP analysis and NMDS ordination (Fig. 5b).
These results suggest that the spatial patchiness of water quality characteristics is regulated by canal stage
through inundation of downstream habitats by canal water inputs. During periods of inundation (i.e. March,
April 2010), water column chemistry is regulated largely by inputs from the Tamiami Canal, and water quality
at sites essentially is homogeneous (Fig. 5b). During periods of low canal stage (i.e. December 2009, January
2010), areas downstream of the culverts are no longer completely inundated, and water chemistry is regulated
by small-scale mechanisms operating within isolated parcels of water. This phenomenon was most
pronounced at the north and central transect sites, while south transect sites remained relatively homogeneous
throughout the sampling period.
Like the water, the diatom communities within the swales sample area exhibit a substantial degree of
spatial heterogeneity. One hundred twenty-seven diatom taxa were encountered in this study, and while this
represents a high taxonomic diversity for such a small area in the Everglades, the richness is consistent with
other studies that examined a similar variety of habitat types (138 taxa from 125 samples ranging from Lake
Okeechobee to the oligohaline ecotone; CERP 2005 unpublished data). Diatom diversity, expressed both as
species richness and as Shannon's index, was highest in the north and central transect sites. This elevated
diversity is reflective of the increased structural complexity of the available habitat within the vegetation halo
and surrounding area, as we were able to sample three different substrate types (benthos, periphyton, woody
debris) in all of the north and central transect sites, but only two at the southern sites. These results are
consistent with patterns observed elsewhere in the Everglades (CERP 2005 unpublished data) and with
relationships between structural habitat complexity and taxonomic diversity demonstrated in other systems
(MacArthur & MacArthur 1961, Connell & Orias 1964, Pianka 1967, Johnson & Simberloff 1974, Taniguchi
& Tokeshi 2004, Bramburger et al. 2008).
General NMDS patterns illustrated that pool diatom assemblages had a high degree of overlap with north
transect assemblages (Fig. 7) at the end of the wet season. Although these assemblages bear a strong
resemblance to those observed in WCA2 and WCA3 (Gaiser et al. 2006, McCormick and O’Dell 1996), and
the overlap observed here is probably a phenomenon driven by propagule flow, increased MVDISP dispersion
among north and central sites emphasizes the influence of habitat complexity on these assemblages.
Contrastingly, diatom assemblages at the south transect sites were identified by ANOSIM as being distinct to
all other groups within the study, and exhibited lower dispersion among sites than north and central transect

sites, demonstrating the effects of lower structural habitat complexity, longer periods of inundation, and the
self-stabilizing nature of the unique periphyton mats commonly observed in the southern Everglades (Donar
et al. 2004, Gaiser et al. 2011). Although diatoms were sampled during an inundated period at the end of the
wet season prior to the initiation of construction activities at the swales sites, patterns of assemblage similarity
were reflective of water quality patterns observed during periods of low water depth in December 2009 and
January 2010. Taken together, these findings illustrate the importance of habitat heterogeneity and occasional
isolation of habitat patches via drying in the maintenance of diatom community diversity in Everglades
National Park.

FIGURE 7: Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling ordination plot for diatom assemblage similarity among transect sites. Bray-Curtis
similarity is the distance metric. Two dimensional stress = 0.15.

This study highlights the importance of monitoring and adaptive management as the Tamiami Trail
modifications continue. Our data suggest that water column chemistry is prone to frequent fluctuations in
response to weather patterns and anthropogenically-regulated hydrology, and is perhaps too confounded to
serve as an ideal indicator of the effects of spreader swale installation. Diatom assemblages, on the other hand,
are relatively unaffected by short-term changes in precipitation and hydrological management, but appear to
be sensitive indicators of changes in environmental parameters associated with long-term change (Pan et al
2000, Gaiser et al 2006, Bramburger et al 2008). The composition of assemblages within the transitional area
(central transect) is of particular interest, and shifts in the composition of these sites towards assemblages
more characteristic of either the northern or southern transects could help to elucidate the effects of spreader
swale installation on subtle habitat characteristics. Multi-variable models such as NMDS based on diatom
community data will provide a useful means of monitoring compositional trends post-swale installation.
From a management perspective, it is important to be clear about the desired outcome of flow regime
modifications. This study suggests the importance of habitat diversity in the maintenance of spatially and
taxonomically diverse diatom assemblages, consistent with currently and classically accepted paradigms of
structural complexity supporting biodiversity (MacArthur & MacArthur 1961, Pianka 1967). It is possible
that the proposed hydrological modifications, which should result in continuous inundation at our north and
central transect sites, will result in decreased spatial heterogeneity in the north and central transect diatom

assemblages, and a shift to assemblages more characteristic of the southern sawgrass prairie. Alternatively,
improved water conveyance into the park could increase propagule pressure, and result in a southward
expansion of assemblages typically reported from the water conservation areas north of Tamiami Trail. The
importance of a sensitive monitoring program and adaptive management strategies for projects improving
water conveyance to Everglades National Park cannot be overstated. This study suggests that wetland diatom
assemblages are sensitive, assimilative indicators of long-term trends, and may provide evidence
complementary to traditional water quality analysis.
