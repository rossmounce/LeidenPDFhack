Abstract
A new species of betel nut palm, Areca unipa, is described and illustrated here for the first time. This is the second
species of Areca from New Guinea that is closely related to the widespread, cultivated species A. catechu. A discussion
of its morphological characters, distribution, ecology, habitat, uses and conservation status is provided.
Key words: Arecaceae, Palmae, palms, New Guinea, taxonomy

Introduction
Botanical exploration in New Guinea continues to yield novelties, even in the well-known groups of plants
such as palms. Since the Palms of New Guinea (PONG) Project (Baker 2002) was initiated in 2000, more than
50 new species have been described (e.g. Baker & Heatubun 2012, Baker et al. 2006, Banka & Baker 2004,
Banka & Barfod 2004, Barfod & Heatubun 2009, Dransfield et al. 2000, Heatubun 2008, Heatubun & Barfod
2008, Heatubun et al. 2009) and at least one new species has been discovered on almost every field trip. Here
we describe a new species of the betel nut palm genus Areca (Arecaceae), which has been lately discovered in
New Guinea despite the recent completion of a monograph of the genus in East Malesia (Heatubun et al.
2012).

Taxonomic Treatment
Areca unipa Heatubun, sp. nov.
Type:—INDONESIA. West Papua Province: Maybrat Regency, East Aifat District, Ayata village, PT. Bima Cakrawala

138 (holotype MAN!, isotype K!).
Diagnosis:—This new species is similar to Areca catechu L. and Areca mandacanii Heatubun in habit and inflorescence
structure, but differs by having fewer leaves in the crown, by the slender leaf rachis and relatively long petiole, and
the sigmoid multifold leaflets and broadly wedge-shaped terminal leaflets.

Solitary, slender palm tall up to 12 m high. Stem ca. 7.5 cm diam.; internodes 3–16 cm long, leaf scars 1–1.5
cm wide, not conspicuous, green near crown and dark to brownish grey near the base. Leaves 7 in crown,

pair 14 cm long, 2–4 cm wide at the base and 4–7 cm at the tip, with 3–6 folds, broadly wedge-shaped to
slightly cuneate, notched tips, the second and third leaflet pairs below the terminal pair splitting between the
folds to about half way to the base, papery, discolorous, darker adaxially than abaxially. Inflorescence
infrafoliar, slender, 30−40 cm long and 10−15 cm wide, protandrous, branching to 2 orders; prophyll

wide, slender, pale green, elongate and sinuous near the base; floral clusters distichous on rachillae, only one
complete triad including female flower occurring at the base of each rachilla, remaining clusters comprising
very few paired and solitary staminate flowers. Staminate flowers small, sessile, triangular, elongate or teardrop shaped, 4.5–6 × 2.1–2.5 mm in bud, asymmetric; sepals 3, low, ca. 2.1–2.5 × 1.1–1.5 mm, united at the
base; petals 3, triangular, elongate or spathulate, 4.2–5 × 2.1–3.5 mm, striate; stamens 6, small, 2.2–2.8 mm
long and 1 mm wide; filaments thick, 0.9 mm long and 0.1–0.4 mm wide, darker than anther; anthers ca. 2.2
mm long and 0.6 mm wide, sagittate, longer than the filaments; pistillode longer than stamens, 2.5–3.2 × 0.8–
1 mm, trifid. Pistillate flowers larger than the staminate, triangular, borne on the enlarged basal portion of
rachillae, only one per rachillae, buds varying greatly in size depending on stage of development, 1.1 × 0.9 cm
(in bud) to 2 × 1 cm (in late anthesis); sepals 3, strongly imbricate, ca. 1.5 × 0.9 mm in late anthesis,
triangular, asymmetrical, striate; petals 3, imbricate, triangular, ca. 1.3 × 0.8 mm in late anthesis, striate;
gynoecium 7–12 mm long and 3–5 mm; stigma ca. 3 mm long, pointed with 3 lobes, 0.3 mm long; style ca.
5–9 mm long; staminodal ring encircling gynoecium, 2 mm high, lacking differentiated staminodes. Fruit
obovoid or ovoid with beak at the apex, 5.5−6 × 3.5−3.8 cm (unripe fruits), beak 4−6 mm long and 5–6 mm in
diam.; epicarp smooth, shiny, dark green (unripe), mature fruits not seen; mesocarp fibrous, 0.5 cm thick, 1.5
cm thick at the base (below the seed); endocarp very thin, adhering closely to the seed. Seed obovoid, slightly
flattened at base, ca. 3 × 2.2 cm (from unripe fruits); endosperm ruminate. Eophyl bifid. (Figures 1 & 2).
Distribution:—Known only from the type locality in PT Bima Cakrawala Nusantara (a coal mining
company) concession area, close to Ayata village in East Maybrat District, Maybrat Regency in the central
part of the Bird’s Head Peninsula, West Papua Province, Indonesia.
Habitat:—This species grows in primary lowland peat forest at an elevation of about 200 m above sea
level. It appears to be adapted to extreme conditions of the coal beds, which sometimes lack any apparent soil,
except for leaf litter over the coal outcrop. Other palms observed growing in association with this new Areca
include Calyptrocalyx sp., several species of Hydriastele, Linospadix albertisianus (Becc.) Burret (1935:
331), Licuala beccariana Furtado (1940: 37), Licuala bifida Heatubun & Barfod (2008: 431) and Sommieria
leucophylla Beccari (1877: 67).
Local names:—Srah Owei Knu in (Aifat dialect, Mai Brat language). When the seedlings were planted in
the nursery of the University campus in Manokwari, they were nicknamed pinang unipa (i.e. the betel nut of
Universitas Papua).
Uses:—The fruits are chewed as a betel nut substitute. However, the palm has potential as an ornamental.
Conservation status:––Critically Endangered CR B2ab (ii,iii,v), C1, E (IUCN 2012). This palm meets
the criteria for the extinction risk category Critically Endangered (IUCN 2012) because its area of occupancy
is estimated to be less than 10 km2 and it is known to exist only in one population in a single locality. Habitat
loss from both coal mining and oil palm plantation were identified as the major threat not only for this new
species but also to the other plants in the region. It is projected that the area of occupancy, the area, extent and
quality of habitat and the number of mature individuals will decline due to the coal mining activities. In
addition, population size is estimated to number less than 250 mature palms. Plants occur at low density, with
only two mature individuals found within a 10 ha plot. We also believe that the population will decline due to
traditional harvesting by local people for the fruits as betel nut substitute, which they collect by chopping
down mature individuals. The combination of threats faced by this very rare species strongly support our
assessment of Critically Endangered.

HEATUBUN ET AL.

Etymology:—The specific epithet refers to the acronym of Universitas Papua (the State University of
Papua—UNIPA). This new species is named in celebration of the 10th anniversary of Universitas Papua and
formalizes its nickname “pinang unipa”.
Discussion:––Prior to the discovery of this new taxon, three species of Areca were known from New
Guinea (Heatubun, 2008; Heatubun et al. 2012). The most widespread species, A. macrocalyx Zipp. ex Blume
(1839: 75), is highly variable and some forms are superficially similar to A. unipa in vegetative morphology.
However, A. macrocalyx has highly distinctive reproductive structures that are quite unlike A. unipa. Its
inflorescence is protogynous, branched to one order (rarely two orders) and bears numerous (up to 600),
closely spaced, slender, sinuous rachillae. Pistillate flowers occur only at the very base of the rachillae, the
remaining portion bearing purely staminate flowers and drying and falling after anthesis. The maturing
infructescence becomes congested with fruit, appearing spicate or club-like. None of these features
correspond with A. unipa.
Areca unipa is most similar to A. catechu Linnaeus (1753: 1189) and A. mandacanii Heatubun (2008:
199) in its solitary, moderate tree palm habit and inflorescence structure, but it can immediately be
distinguished by the small, slender leaves with relatively long petiole and very few multifold, sigmoid and
broadly wedge-shaped leaflets. In contrast, A. catechu bears larger leaves with petiole short or almost lacking
and single and/or multi-fold, linear leaflets, while A. mandacanii bears single-fold, linear leaflets that are
arranged irregularly in groups and in several ranks. Besides that, this new species is smaller in almost all
dimensions than A. catechu and A. mandacanii. For instance, A. unipa has seven leaves in the crown, a leaf
about 102 cm long, 9–10 leaflets on each side of rachis, and inflorescence that is 30–40 cm long and branched
to 2 orders. Areca catechu has 8–12 leaves in the crown, the leaf is 150–270 cm long with 20–35 leaflets on
each side of rachis, and the inflorescence is 29–80 cm long and branched to 2–3 orders. Areca mandacanii has
8 leaves in the crown, the leaf is 200–250 cm long with about 60 leaflets each side of rachis, and the
inflorescence is about 60 cm long and mostly branched to 2 (rarely 3) orders.
Though distinct, A. unipa, like A. mandacanii, is closely related to A. catechu, in its inflorescence
architecture (divaricate panicle inflorescence with elongated branches and rachillae), the distichous floral
clusters with only complete triad including female flower occuring at the base of each rachilla, the free sepals
of staminate flowers (or sometimes fused at the base), six stamens and typical betel nut-like fruits. The
discovery of yet another relative of A. catechu draws further attention to New Guinea as a potential area of
origin for A. catechu as already highlighted by Heatubun et al. (2012). It is of great concern that this wild
relative of an important crop species is so intensely threatened in its natural habitat.
