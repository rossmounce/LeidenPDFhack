Abstract
Populations of several Psammothidium species were found in core sediments from nine remote, high elevation,
ultraoligotrophic and oligotrophic, Olympic and Cascade Mountain lakes. Three of these species, P. lacustre, P. alpinum,
and P. nivale, are described here as new. The morphology of the silica frustules of these species was documented using
light and scanning electron microscopy. We discuss the similarities and differences with previously described
Psammothidium species.
Key words: diatom, lake sediments, alpine lakes, LM, SEM

Introduction
Diatom assemblages were analyzed in core sediments from nine Washington Cascade Mountains lakes. These
lakes were selected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for a paleolimnological investigation of the impact
of inorganic nitrogen atmospheric deposition on lake biogeochemistry. However, these lakes are still generally
considered oligotrophic systems.
Species of Psammothidium Bukhtiyarova & Round (1996: 3) are very abundant (up to 28% relative abundance) and
diverse in study lakes and they were investigated with both light (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
Psammothidium was separated from Achnanthidium Kützing (1844: 75) by Bukhtiyarova & Round (1996) to designate
adnate taxa commonly attached to sand grains by the raphe valve face, as opposed to Achnanthidium species, which are
more common on stable surfaces such as rocks and plants and found attached via short mucilaginous stalks.
Bukhtiyarova & Round (1996) pointed out that the major morphological differences between Psammothidium and
Achnanthidium are (1) the shape of the valve, oval-elliptic as opposed to linear/linear-capitate; (2) the convex flexure of
the raphe valve as opposed to concave in Achnanthidium; (3) striae reaching the sternum as opposed to marginal in
Achnanthidium; and (4) raphe fissures located in a central channel (or near the valve center) as opposed to non-channeled
with pin-hole central endings in Achnanthidium (Bukhtiyarova & Round 1996).

Among Psammothidium species occurring in the study lakes, based on silica frustule morphological
characteristics, three species are new to science. Here we describe those new species using light (LM) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations.

Material and Methods
Sediment cores were collected by USGS crews in the summer of 2009 from nine lakes in Olympic, North
Cascades, and Mt. Rainier national parks, located at a minimum elevation of 1335 m. A summary of lake
physical characteristics is given in Table 1. Cores were collected by boat from the deepest portion of each lake
using a Uwitec gravity corer (http://www.uwitec.at/).

Diatom slides were prepared using strong acid digestions in a microwave (CEM model MDS-21 00) with
enclosed vessels, and temperature and pressure monitoring and control systems. Diatom-coated coverslips
were mounted on glass slides using Naphrax R mounting medium (http://diatom.ansp.org/nawqa/
protocols.asp). Diatom species were investigated in core top (0–0.5-cm depth) and bottom sediments, and in
an additional interval from Snow Lake (2–2.5 cm).
A Zeiss Axio Imager microscope equipped with AxioCam MRm digital camera was used for LM. For
SEM, cleaned material was dried on aluminum stubs, which were sputter-coated with Pt-Pd and observed with
a Zeiss Supra 50 VP FE SEM (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Terminology
used to describe valve structure follows Anonymous (1975), Bukhtiyarova & Round (1996) and Round et al.
(1990).
Water samples for nutrient analysis were collected and processed according to methods outlined in the
USGS National Field Manual (US Geological Survey, 2006; Wilde et al., 2004). Water chemistry
measurements indicated that the study lakes are ultraoligotrophic or oligotrophic (Table 2).

The number of Psammothidium species in core top sediments was higher than in bottom sediments. For
example, P. marginulatum was observed in bottom sediments from four lakes versus top sediments from
seven lakes, while P. helveticum was observed in bottom sediments from five lakes versus top sediments from
seven lakes (Table 3). The most abundant species across all study sites were P. curtissimum (maximum
relative abundance 28%) and P. scoticum (maximum relative abundance 22%). The new species (P. lacustre
sp. nov., P. alpinum sp. nov., and P. nivale sp. nov) were found in core material from six lakes: Hidden Lake
NOCA, Eunice, Snow, Stiletto, Hoh, and Copper lakes.

Etymology:—specific epithet refers to the occurrence of the new species in a lacustrine environment.
The species with the closest morphological features to Psammothidium lacustre is P. helveticum (Figs 32–
34). Psammothidium lacustre has much larger size, with valve width greather than 8 µm, and more acute valve
ends compared to P. helveticum. SEM investigations (Figs 35–39) revealed that the proximal raphe endings
are internally slightly deflected in opposite directions (Fig. 36), similarly to P. helveticum (see Bukhtiyarova
& Round 1996, figure 23). The striae extend uninterrupted onto the mantle, and short striae are present near
the central area and occasionally in other parts of valve margin (Fig. 38). Areolae have round external
foramina and transapically elongated internal openings (Figs 37, 39).
The shape of the axial and central areas on rapheless valves is similar in Psammothidium lacustre and P.
helveticum, except that the central area is narrower in P. helveticum. Internally, the shape of areolae is also
different: elongated with rims and grooves in P. lacustre versus round or rectangular in P. helveticum (see
Bukhtiyarova & Round 1996, figure 23). In LM, P. lacustre is relatively easy to separate from P. helveticum;
P. lacustre is larger, has more lanceolate shape, and coarser striae (22 –24 versus 23 – 28) and areolae.
Psammothidium lacustre was rare in study lakes (<1% relative abundance).
Psammothidium alpinum Potapova & Enache sp. nov. (Figs 9–21, 40–44)
Valvae linearae ellipticae, ovalis, 6.3–9.1 µm latae, 14.6–30 µm longae. Raphovalva cum area axialis angusta linearis
versus, area centralis rectagularis. Raphe recta poris centralibus unciformis, termini distale punctiformis.
Araphovalva cum area axialis angusta, area centralis circularis, irregularis, 1/2 valvae lata. Striae transapicales
paulo radiatae, 22–25 in 10 µm cum striae breviores intercalares. Areolae rotundae, grossae, 25 in 10 µm.
Valves linear-elliptic to oval, 6.3–9.1 µm wide, 14.6–30 µm long. Raphe valve with narrow linear axial area and
rectangular-irregular central area. Raphe straight with hook-like proximal pores, drop-shaped distal endings (Figs
10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 20). Rapheless valve with narrow axial area, irregular, rounded central area, occupying about ½ of
valve breadth (Figs 9, 12, 14, 17–19, 21). Transapical striae slightly radiate, 22–25 in 10 µm, with shortened
marginal striae present (figs 41, 43). Areolae coarse, round, 25 in 10 µm (Fig. 44).
Type:—USA. Washington: Cascade Mountains, Snow Lake, 46.7576° N, 121.6982468° W, lake sediment (2–2.5-cm
depth core interval; lake maximum depth 9.75 m), collected 07 October 2009, collection WACA019, (Circled
specimen (Figs 9, 10) on slide GC64862, accession #GC64862 (ANSP!), holotype, designated here; circled
specimens on slide GC64863 (ANSP!) and slide 84223 (CANA!), isotypes, designated here).

Etymology:—specific epithet refers to the occurrence of the new species in alpine, high elevation lakes.
Psammothidium alpinum is similar to P. bioretii (Germain 1957: 85) Bukhtiyarova et Round (1996: 9) in
valve size and possession of relatively coarse areolae. It differs from P. bioretii by having more elongate,
linear-elliptical valve shape with nearly parallel sides, and a straight central sternum (versus diagonal in P.
bioretii). In SEM (Figs 40–44), P. alpinum displays a characteristic doublet of smaller areolae at the valve/
mantle junction and around the mantle (Figs 40, 42). On raphe valves, the central area nearly reaches the valve
margin and is bounded by 4–8 short striae. The raphe has characteristic hook-like widely spaced proximal
endings (Fig 40) that deflect in the same direction externally (Fig. 40) and opposite internally (Fig. 41). While
P. bioretii has terminal raphe fissures curved to opposite sides, P. alpinum lacks terminal fissures, and distal
external raphe endings are drop-shaped and do not expand beyond the last stria (Fig. 41). Similar to P. bioretii,
P. alpinum has coarse, round areolae visible in LM; a row of coarser areolae border the sternum and central
area in LM (Figs 10, 11) and a double row of finer areolae bordering the valve face-mantle junction is visible
in SEM (Figs 40, 42). Short intercalary striae are present along the valve margin and expand on the mantle
(Figs 41, 43). Psammothidium alpinum has similar valve shape as P. chlidanos (Hohn et Hellerman 1963: 273)
Lange-Bertalot (1999: 285) but it can be easily distinguished by its coarser striae and areolae visible in LM.
P. alpinum was present in Hidden Lake NOCA (bottom sample, 2% relative abundance) and very rare in
top samples from Snow and Stiletto lakes.

Valves elliptical, 5.6–6 µm wide and 11.7–15 µm long. Raphe valve with linear axial area, central area transapically
rectangular to oval occupying 2/3 of the valve breadth. Raphe with proximal pores slightly expanded, located in
grooves, and with simple distal endings (Figs 23, 25, 27, 28). Rapheless valve with axial area narrow at apices and
widening towards valve centre in a rhombic-lanceolate shape, occupying 2/3 of the valve breadth (Figs 22, 24, 26,
29, 30). Striae slightly radiate, 26–28 in 10 µm on rapheless valve, 30–32 on raphe valve.
Type:— USA. Washington: Cascade Mountains, Snow Lake, 46.7576° N, 121.6982468° W, lake sediment (2–2.5-cm
depth core interval; lake maximum depth 9.75 m), collected 07 October 2009, collection WACA019, (Circled
specimen (Figs 22, 23) on slide GC64864, accession #GC64864 (ANSP!), holotype, designated here; circled
specimens on slide GC64865 (ANSP!) and slide 84224 (CANA!), isotypes, designated here).

Etymology:—specific epithet refers to the name of the lake (Snow Lake) from where the species was found
and described.
Psammothidium nivale is distinguished from other Psammothidium species by characteristic coarser striae
and areolae on rapheless valve compared to raphe valve. The linear axial area on raphe valves widens slightly
near the valve center, and the transapically rectangular to oval central area is bounded by 4–5 shortened striae.
External proximal raphe endings are located in grooves, which gradually widen toward valve center. External
distal raphe endings are drop-shaped and do not extend beyond the last stria (Fig. 45). Characteristic coarse
areolae on rapheless valves have the appearance of transapically elongated slits in SEM (Figs 47–48).
In the SEM, the shape of the areolae—transapically elongate—resemble those of P. subatomoides in
SEM. However, P. nivale is distinguished from the latter species by all other valve characteristics: more
elongated shape of the valve and larger size, shape of central area on both raphe and rapheless valve and clear
dimorphism of raphe and rapheless valve in striae density and areolae size. P. nivale was found in Snow Lake
and Hidden Lake NOCA in very low abundance (< 0.25% relative abundance).
