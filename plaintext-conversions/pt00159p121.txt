Abstract
Sedum citrinum is described as a narrow endemic from three populations on ultramafic bedrock in the Klamath
Mountains of southern Del Norte County, California, in the United States. It is distinguished from Sedum obtusatum
subsp. boreale by its flattened inflorescence with elongate lower branches, as well as its deep yellow flowers and yellow
anthers.
Key words: serpentine, succulent plants

Introduction
Sedum Linnaeus (1753: 430) sect. Gormania (Britton in Britton & Rose 1930: 29) R. T. Clausen (1942: 29) is a
group of six perennial stonecrop species with stout flattened rosette leaves, paniculate inflorescences, and basally
fused corollas. The section was summarized by Clausen (1975), Denton (1979a, 1979b, 1982, 1993), and more
recently by Ohba (2007, 2009) and Denton and Boyd (2012). The species of Sedum sect. Gormania are distributed
in California, western Nevada, and Oregon, and are restricted to western North America. Traditional herbariumbased research can be difficult with fragile dried plants such as stonecrops. Like many succulent genera, when
handled, dried Sedum falls apart over time, important colors are rarely preserved in the lengthy drying process,
seldom noted on labels, and the preserved flowers show few useful characters without special preparation.
Taxonomic study is enriched by examining the fresh flowering plants in the field, and using color photographs to
show such characters as the glaucous epidermis of sepals, corolla and stamen colors, as well as the aspect of the
fresh foliage. Other useful morphological features are difficult to examine on dried specimens, such as nectary
shape, petal fusion, width, or angle. When integrating these features, it is clear that sect. Gormania is in need of
further research and revision.
Extensive field work on the perennial stonecrops of Sedum sect. Gormania of northern California was
instigated by the United States Forest Service in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and involved more than a
dozen botanists. It indirectly led to the discovery of a new stonecrop in the southern mountains of Del Norte
County, California, described below.

Methods
Dried specimen preparation is challenging with Sedum because they store so much water in their foliage. The
succulent tissue must be treated before drying in a press. Use of a microwave for the 2012 gatherings resulted in the
quick wilting of the specimens, and they were easily, if slowly, dried over low heat. However, the resulting
specimens were inadequate for DNA testing. Herbarium collections cited below from 2013 were frozen and then
dried, to accommodate the possibility of subsequent molecular work. Some flowers and leaves were separated from
the plants for photography, dried separately, and placed in fragment packets, where they can be easily sampled by

posted on-line with the collection number, to supplement notes on the herbarium labels.

26201 (CAS!, GH!, OSC!, RSA!, WTU!).
Relationships with other taxa:—Sedum citrinum is assigned to sect. Gormania (Denton 1982). The typical
corollas of species in sect. Gormania fall into three general categories (Table 1). One is a pink-flowered corolla
with elongate, erect, and narrow-tapering petal tips, displayed by Sedum laxum (Britton in Britton & Rose 1903:
29) A. Berger (1930: 451) subsp. laxum, S. laxum subsp. heckneri (M. Peck 1937: 121) R. T. Clausen (1942: 39),
and S. laxum subsp. latifolium R. T. Clausen (1942: 38)(Fig. 3A–C). These subspecies have a distinctive flower
shape and color, as well as a unique combination of dark red anthers and pink filaments. The corollas age to red or
dark red. Although S. moranii R. T. Clausen (1942: 40) of southwestern Oregon has a similar corolla shape, the
flowers are glandular and a different color. A second floral morphology consists of ascending to spreadingascending and rather broad petals, usually pale yellow or white, but sometimes fading to pink with age. Examples
of these are S. albomarginatum R. T. Clausen (1975: 424), S. laxum subsp. flavidum Denton (1978: 233), S.
obtusatum A. Gray (1868: 342) subsp. obtusatum, S. obtusatum subsp. paradisum Denton (1978: 236), and S.
oregonense (S. Watson 1882: 373) M. Peck (1941: 361)(Fig. 3D–J). Strikingly different in the field is a third floral
morphology, displayed only by S. obtusatum subsp. boreale R. T. Clausen (1942: 32) and S. citrinum. The petals
are relatively narrow and wide-spreading, with age they are sometimes slightly reflexed (Fig. 3K–R). The pale
yellow petals and red (less commonly orange or yellow) anthers of S. obtusatum subsp. boreale differ from the
deep yellow petals and uniformly yellow anthers of S. citrinum.

Another useful character on fresh plants is the type of growth on the vigorous vegetative offsets, although this
can require a bit of experience to interpret correctly. Most species, in sunny situations, display condensed
vegetative offsets, with inconspicuous distal internodes, crowded and difficult to see between the leaf bases of the
terminal rosette. Examples include Sedum laxum subsp. flavidum, S. laxum subsp. heckneri, S. oblanceolatum R. T.
Clausen (1975: 404), and S. obtusatum subsp. obtusatum (Fig. 4A–F). However, any species in a protected or
shaded location, such as between two sheltering rocks on a talus slope, seems to suffer less water stress and can
infrequently produce elongate vegetative shoot tips. None-the-less, in sunny and exposed situations a few members
of sect. Gormania characteristically produce numerous vigorous vegetative shoots, with loose foliage and easily
visible distal internodes. These are S. citrinum, S. obtusatum subsp. boreale, and S. oregonense (Fig. 4G–N). In the

most exposed and xeric localities, even these taxa can produce relatively dense vegetative shoots, but in general
most plants of most populations have well-spaced leaves on the shoot tips. Sedum citrinum can be separated from
vegetatively similar plants of S. obtusatum subsp. boreale, and S. oregonense by floral characters, as discussed
above and illustrated in Fig. 3.

When working with living material, early in the flowering season, the stem leaves can provide useful
taxonomic information when distinctive morphologies are present. However, the stem leaf shape can vary, and
some shapes are common among different taxa. The stem leaves on blooming shoots seem to serve as water storage
for the flowering effort. They tend to shrivel, then drop off as the flowers age, and are seldom present on herbarium
specimens. The most distinctive stem leaves in sect. Gormania have decurrent bases, uniquely found on Sedum
laxum subsp. laxum (Fig. 5A–B). Two species have oblanceolate and elongate stem leaves, much like their
oblanceolate and elongate rosette leaves; these are S. albomarginatum and S. oblanceolatum (Fig. 5C–E). A few
taxa have suborbicular stem leaves with clasping bases, most notably including S. laxum subsp. flavidum, S. laxum
subsp. heckneri, and some populations of both S. obtusatum subsp. retusum (Rose, in Britton & Rose 1903: 31) R.
T. Clausen (1975: 375), and S. oregonense (Fig. 5F–M). The remaining taxa in sect. Gormania tend to have stem
leaves longer than wide, and truncate at the base instead of clasping. This includes S. citrinum, S. laxum subsp.

The inflorescences can provide useful characters for distinguishing species. Some taxa in sect. Gormania have
cylindrical inflorescences, with the proximal branches suppressed and short. This includes Sedum obtusatum subsp.
boreale (Fig. 6A–E), which typically has an inflorescence 1.5–5 cm wide, with up to 54 flowers. In marked
contrast, S. citrinum has a flat-topped inflorescence (Fig. 6F–H), with elongated lower branches. The inflorescence
of S. citrinum is usually 2–9 cm wide, and can contain up to 95 flowers. Also noteworthy is the uncommon
tendency of some plants of S. citrinum to produce more than one fertile shoot from a single rosette, which is less
frequently seen in other members of sect. Gormania (Figs. 1, 6G–H). Sedum obtusatum subsp. boreale does not
seem to commonly branch at the base of the fertile shoots (Fig. 6I).
In summary, Sedum citrinum is most similar morphologically to S. obtusatum subsp. boreale (Table 1). They
both display widely spaced leaves on their sterile shoots (Fig. 4), and elongate, truncate-based stem leaves (Fig. 5).
In critical floral features, both exhibit narrow divergent petals not seen in any other taxa in the section Gormania

(Fig. 3). The two are separable by inflorescence shape and width (Fig. 6), as well as by the intensity of the yellow
pigment of the corolla and anther color variation (Figs. 2–3). Anthesis ends for S. citrinum in late June as it is
starting for S. obtusatum subsp. boreale. In addition, S. citrinum is restricted to ultramafic exposures (Fig. 7), while
S. obtusatum subsp. boreale is found on a wide variety of bedrock, including volcanics, metamorphics, and
utramafics. Finally, the distribution of S. citrinum is restricted to a tiny portion of Del Norte County, discussed
below. The distribution of S. obtusatum subsp. boreale is allopatric, and covers a much larger area to the south and
east, in Siskiyou and Trinity counties, over a broader range of elevations. When compared to other members of the
group, both S. citrinum and S. obtusatum subsp. boreale differ strongly enough in floral characters to be considered
separate species. Related taxa, like S. oregonense to the north, and S. obtusatum subsp. obtusatum to the southeast,
have quite different corollas and distributions. (Fig. 3, Table 1).

Etymology:—The epithet citrinum reflects the color of the petals, which are a bright lemon yellow. A
proposed common name is Blue Creek stonecrop, as all known records are from within this drainage.
Distribution and conservation:—Blue Creek stonecrop is restricted to the ridges between Red Mountain and
South Red Mountain, in southern Del Norte County, California, over a linear distance of less than 4 km, and within
an area of roughly 4 square km. The slopes are drained by tributaries of Blue Creek, in the lower Klamath River
basin, part of the Klamath Ranges subregion of the California Floristic Province (Baldwin et al. 2012).
Geologically the substrate is part of the extensive Josephine Peridotite exposures, which extend for 130 km from
Josephine County, Oregon south to Humboldt County, California (Evans 1984).
More field work is needed to determine if there are additional colonies in the immediate area. At present fewer
than 2000 plants are known, restricted to three populations in a small zone, suggesting some conservation efforts
may be appropriate. More than 20 regional endemics, restricted to serpentine, are listed as rare in the Klamath
Ranges by Nakamura and Nelson (2001, Table 3b). Using IUCN criteria (2013), S. citrinum would be vulnerable. It
faces some risks in its remote stony habitats, including road-widening, road maintenance and off-road vehicles.

Phenology and ecology:—Sedum citrinum flowers have been recorded from 9–24 June. The habitat is
characterized by sunny dry thin soils of serpentine (ultramafic) exposures, on talus or scree, in crevices or between
boulders, on flats or ground gently sloping east or west, and on adjacent roadcuts, at elevations of 1050–1235 m
