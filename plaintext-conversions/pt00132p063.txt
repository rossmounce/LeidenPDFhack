Abstract
Senegalia hoehnei from the states of Bahia, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Pará, Paraná, and
Santa Catarina, is described, illustrated, and compared to its probable nearest relative, Senegalia martiusiana.
Key words: Fabaceae, IUCN Red List, Mimosoideae, Brazil, Senegalia

Introduction
Historically, the genus Senegalia has often been treated as part of Acacia s.l., but recent morphological and
genetic studies have shown that this large genus is polyphyletic. Data derived from molecular studies have
led to a better understanding of the relationships within the genus Acacia s.l., as well as the position of the
genus within the Mimosoideae (Maslin et al. 2003a, Miller & Bayer 2003, Luckow et al. 2003, Miller et al.
2003, Rico-Arce & Bachman 2006, Seigler et al. 2006a, Bouchenak-Khelladi et al. 2010, Gómez-Acevedo et
al. 2010, Murphy et al. 2010, Miller & Seigler 2012, Kyalangalilwa et al. 2013). Based on these data, Acacia
s.l. is now regarded as comprising at least five genera, Acacia s. s., Acaciella Britton & Rose (1928: 98),
Mariosousa Seigler & Ebinger (Seigler et al. 2006b: 415), Senegalia Rafinesque (1838: 119), and Vachellia
Wight & Arnott (1834: 272) (see Miller & Seigler 2012 for overview of the new generic classification).
Members of Senegalia are shrubs, trees, or lianas, unarmed or armed with prickles, but without stipular
spines. The prickles usually are scattered, but less commonly are grouped in twos or threes, usually at or near
the nodes (Vassal 1972). Leaves are bipinnate and the petiole and primary rachis have sessile or stipitate
glands of variable position. Flowers possess a more or less tubular nectary below the usually stipitate ovary.
Inflorescences are globose heads or spikes, often grouped into complex terminal pseudo-inflorescences
(synflorescences). Pods are dehiscent, separating into two valves at maturity, or less commonly indehiscent or
separating into indehiscent one seeded articles. The seeds are uniseriate.
The genus Senegalia consists of approximately 100 taxa in the Americas (unpublished data), as well as 69
in Africa, 43 in Asia, and two in Australia (Maslin et al., 2003a,b). Eight species occur in two or more areas.
During the course of our work on the genus Senegalia of Brazil, a previously undescribed species was noted
from herbarium materials of eastern and southeastern Brazil. This taxon is clearly distinctive and is herein
proposed as new species.

lateral veins not obvious, one subcentral vein from the base, base oblique, truncate on one side, margins
lightly ciliate, apex acute, Inflorescence a densely 20 to 40-flowered globose head 12–17 mm across, in
terminal pseudo-paniculate clusters, the main axis to 300 mm long; peduncles 3–13 x 0.3–0.6 mm thick,
puberulent; receptacle slightly enlarged, elongated; involucre a small bract located along the peduncle, early
deciduous; floral bracts spatulate, 0.5–0.9 mm long, puberulent, early deciduous. Flowers sessile, yellow;
calyx 5-lobed, 1.5–2.0 mm long, puberulent; corolla 5-lobed, 2.4–3.2 mm long, mostly glabrous, lobes onesixth the length of the corolla; stamen filaments 6–8 mm long, distinct; anther glands absent; ovary glabrous,
stipe to 1.1 mm long. Legumes straight, flattened, not constricted between the seeds, oblong, 100–170 x 20–
28 mm wide, chartaceous, transversely striated, glabrous, eglandular, dehiscent along both sutures; stipe 6–13
mm long; apex acute, beaked. Seeds immature seeds elliptical, with pleurogram.
Distribution and ecology:—This species occurs in the Atlantic Domain in dense ombrophilous and
semi-deciduous forests, in the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Pará, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo,
Paraná and Santa Catarina. This domain is a global hotspot for conservation of biodiversity (Myers et al.
2000, Ribeiro et al. 2009). Although much of the vegetation cover in the Atlantic Domain has been removed
or is profoundly altered, several new species are still being described. Much of the taxonomic diversity of the
genus Senegalia in Brazil is present in this domain, comprising at least 11 endemic species, mostly present in
Rain Forest and Restinga physiognomies.
IUCN Red List category:—Data Deficient DD. As noted above, much of the vegetation cover in the
Atlantic Domain has been removed or is profoundly altered. Further, Senegalia hoehnei is apparently
uncommon, we have seen fewer than 13 specimens. These factors suggest that this species may at least be
Vulnerable, perhaps Endangered (IUCN 2010).
Phenology:—Senegalia hoehnei was observed in flower from February to March and in fruit from May
to July.
Etymology:—Named after Frederico Carlos Hoehne, a pioneer of nature conservation in Brazil and a
prolific and influential scientist, writer and manager of scientific institutions, participant in organizations in
the scientific community. He collected extensively in much of Brazil (Andrade Franco & Drummond 2005,
2009).
Common name:—Hoehne’s senegalia

Discussion:—Senegalia hoehnei is a member of a group of species morphologically similar to Senegalia
martiusiana (Steudel, 1841: 148) Seigler & Ebinger (Seigler et al. 2006a: 57). Nearly all specimens were
originally identified as Acacia adhaerens (Martius, 1837: 122) Bentham (1842: 517). [=Senegalia
martiusiana]. S. hoehnei may be separated from S. martiusiana by the longer leaves with 15 to 24 pairs of
pinnae (6 to 17 pairs in S. martusiana), and by the sessile flowers (pedicellate on a stalk 0.9–1.5 mm in S.
martusiana). The short hairs of the twigs, petiole and rachis, less than 0.5 mm long, also separate Senegalia
hoehnei from the other three members of this group of species, S. martiusiana, S. mattogrossensis (Malme,
1931: 45) Seigler & Ebinger (Seigler et al. 2006a: 58), and S. podadenia Britton & Killip (1933: 24).
