Abstract
Two new Ixora species from Madagascar are described, Ixora lagenifructa and I. quadrilocularis. Ixora littoralis,
previously positioned in the monospecific genus Thouarsiora, is newly named I. homolleae. These three species are
characterized by 4-locular ovaries and fruits, 4-lobed stigmas, large fruits with thick walls and well-developed calyces. A
fourth species, I. trimera, shows the same characters but its ovaries are 2-, 3- or 4-locular and its stigmas are 2-, 3- or 4lobed. A dichotomous key, detailed descriptions and distribution maps are given for these four species, the only
multilocular ones in Madagascar.

Introduction
In Madagascar the genus Ixora Linneaus (1753: 110) comprises ca. 40 species, half of which remain undescribed.
This paper is the fourth in a series of precursors to a revision (De Block 2007, 2008; De Block & Van De
Kerckhove 2009), and treats the multilocular species, i.e. those with more than two locules, present on the island.
In Africa and Madagascar, the genus Ixora is easily recognized by the following characters: articulate petioles;
articulate, trichotomously branched, terminal inflorescences; 4-merous flowers with long, cylindrical corolla tubes;
free stigmatic lobes; uni-ovulate locules; drupaceous fruits; and seeds with a large adaxial excavation extending
into a basal groove (De Block 1998). In the past, to this list of key characters would be added: ovaries and fruits 2locular and stigma 2-lobed. Several small genera, closely related to Ixora and often considered as satellite taxa,
were described to accomodate species with more than two locules. The Madagascan monospecific genus
Thouarsiora Homolle ex Arènes (1960: 19) was described for a 4-locular species with uniflorous inflorescences,
Thouarsiora littoralis Homolle ex Arènes (1960: 19). In the Mascarenes, two genera comprised species with
dioecious or functionally dioecious flowers, short corolla tubes and 2–7-locular ovaries: Myonima Commerson ex
Jussieu (1789: 206) with four species and Doricera Verdcourt (1983: 37) with a single species. In the Pacific, Hitoa
Nadeaud (1899: 2) was established for a species with 2–6 flowers per inflorescence and 3- or 4-locular ovaries and
fruits. Over time, it was realized that the number of locules is not a discriminating character after all, and, one by
one, these genera were placed in synonymy with Ixora: Hitoa by Darwin (1979) and Thouarsiora by Guédès
(1986) as previously suggested by Capuron (1969: 48). Guédès (1986) also emended the description of the genus
Ixora to include species with 3- and 4-locular ovaries and 3- and 4-lobed stigmas. In a molecular phylogenetic
study of the tribe Ixoreae, Mouly et al. (2009) confirmed the synonymy of Hitoa and Thouarsiora with Ixora and
also placed Doricera and Myonima in synonymy with Ixora. This resulted in an even broader circumscription of
Ixora including species with up to seven locules per ovary.
Species having ovaries with more than two locules are rare within the ca. 530 species (Davis et al. 2009) of
Ixora, but they do occur in several parts of the distribution range: the Mascarenes (Myonima, Doricera), the Pacific
Region (Hitoa), Australia [Ixora baileyana Bridson & L.G.Adams in Adams et al. (1987: 214)] and Madagascar
(Thouarsiora). The presence of more than two locules is sometimes correlated with dioecy or functional dioecy as
in Myonima, Doricera and Ixora baileyana (Adams et al. 1987, Tosh et al., 2013), but this is not the case in Hitoa
or in the Madagascan species. The phylogenetic analysis published by Mouly et al. (2009, p. 152, fig. 2) clearly
shows that the switch from two to more locules occurred independently several times in the evolution of Ixora.
Furthermore, even in Madagascar this switch seems to have occurred more than once. In a molecular study on the

Madagascan Ixora, which included three out of the four multilocular species (Tosh et al. 2013, Fig. 3), multilocular
species did not form a monophyletic group. Ixora homolleae Govaerts ex De Block (this publication) and I.
quadrilocularis De Block (this publication) were resolved as sister species, but I. lagenifructa De Block (this
publication) fell into a different subclade, which otherwise had only 2-locular species.
The species discussed here are very distinct and cannot be confused with any other Ixora species on the island.
Apart from the multilocular ovaries and fruits, and the stigma with three or four free lobes (rarely two), they differ
from the other Madagascan Ixora species by the following combination of characters: coriaceous leaves; uni- or
pauciflorous inflorescences (1–15 flowers); robust flowers (corolla tubes up to 8 cm long); well-developed calyx
tubes (2.5–10 mm long); large, lageniform fruits, due to the persistent calyx; thick fruit wall; stony pyrenes; and,
relatively small seeds shaped like spherical wedges (instead of the hemispherical or hemiovoid seeds of 2-locular
Ixora species).

Material and methods
Herbarium material and preserved samples were studied from the BR, G, K, MO, P, TAN, TEF and WAG herbaria.
Further material was collected during field work in Madagascar. Terminology generally follows Robbrecht (1988);
leaf terminology is according to Anonymous (1962). The methods used followed normal practice of herbarium
taxonomy (De Vogel 1987). In the descriptions, inflorescence size does not include the corollas, fruit shape and
size does not include the persistent calyx, and, the peduncle is measured from the lowermost pair of inflorescencesupporting leaves to the inflorescence base. Colors given are for dried material except for flower parts and fruits.
Specimens are cited per province and alphabetically by collector. All specimens listed were seen by the author.
Coordinates of localities were determined using the online Gazetteer to Malagasy Botanical Collecting Localities
(Schatz et al. 2003). Also, 1:500.000 maps from the Malagasy Institut National de Géodésie et Cartographie were
used. Distribution maps were drawn using Arcmap 9.2. Abbreviations used: fir., firaisana (commune); fiv.,
fivondronana (district); fok., fokotany (canton).

Notes: —Ixora littoralis (Homolle ex Arènes) Guédès is a later homonym of Ixora littoralis Merril (1910: 240)
and is therefore illegitimate. Rafaël Govaerts (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew) was the first to point this out and to
suggest the new name (as I. homollei Govaerts) in a preliminary version of the World Checklist of Rubiaceae,
which was distributed to Rubiaceae specialists in 1998. The name is corrected here into ‘homolleae’, since it
honours Anne-Marie Homolle.
One of the type specimens (Du Petit-Thouars s.n., P) is annotated as Pyrostria oleoides Lamarck (1792: 289),
which is now considered a synonym of Pyrostria commersonii Gmelin (1791: 246) (Govaerts et al. 2013). This
species is known only from Réunion Island (Mascarenes Islands) and differs in many aspects from Ixora
homolleae, e.g. the inflorescences are axillary and not uniflorous.
Unusually short flowers (corolla tube < 12 mm long) were observed in Dorr & Barnett 3413, a specimen that
further does not differ from the other representatives of I. homolleae.

Vernacular names:—mantalanatorotra; valotrafotsy.
Notes:—This species is easily distinguished by its short bracteoles and calyx lobes, both ≤ 2 mm long. Also, it
lacks the dense sericeous pubescence on the adaxial surfaces of the calyx, bracts and bracteoles that is present in I.
homolleae, I. trimera and I. quadrilocularis. Furthermore, colleters are easily visible all over the adaxial surface of
the calyx tube.
Morphologically, this species seems to fit well with the other 4-locular species. It has the typical lax,
pauciflorous inflorescences, the robust flowers with large calyces and the thick ovary (ca. 1.5 mm) and fruit wall
(ca. 3 mm). However, in the study of Tosh et al. (2013), I. lagenifructa did not form a monophyletic group with I.
homolleae and I. quadrilocularis.

Ixora quadrilocularis De Block, sp. nov. Fig. 3.
Type:—Madagascar, Toamasina, forêt de Sahavolamena, S de Sonierana-Ivongo, 16°56’S, 49°37’E, November 1964, Capuron
23803-SF (holotype P, isotypes BR, TEF).
Similar to Ixora lagenifructa because of the 4-locular ovaries, 4-lobed stigmas, robust flowers, large calyces and fruits and lax,
pedunculate, few-flowered inflorescences, and differing from it by bracteoles 3–12 mm long (vs. 1.5–2 mm long), corolla
lobes 0.8–1.5 cm wide (vs. 0.4–0.7 cm wide), the denser pubescence without visible colleters on the adaxial surface of
bracts and bracteoles (vs. moderately pubescent with visible colleters) and the densely sericeous adaxial surfaces of the
calyx lobes (vs. glabrous surfaces).

Tree, (4–)6–10 m tall; young internodes brown, older internodes grayish brown, grayish or fawn; all external parts
glabrous. Stipule sheath 2–4 mm long, awn (1–)1.5–3.5 mm long. Leaves with petioles 0.5–1.5 cm long; blades
obovate to narrowly obovate, 7–16 × 3–7 cm, coriaceous, drying brown or dark brown and often somewhat glossy
above, paler brown below; apex shortly acuminate (acumen < 0.5(–1) cm), apiculate or acute; base cuneate;
secondary veins 12–18 each side. Inflorescences terminal, trichotomously branched, shortly pedunculate, lax, 2.5–
6.5 × 2.5–7 cm, often 3-flowered but comprising up to 9 flowers; modified inflorescence-supporting leaves absent or

present, if present then preceded by a shorter internode, blades similar in shape to vegetative leaves but smaller, 0.3–
5.5 x 0.3–3 cm; peduncle 0.2–4 cm long; first order axes 1.5–5 cm long; bracts broadly triangular or ovate, vaulted,
adaxial surfaces densely sericeous, apices acuminate. Ultimate flower triads with flowers pedicellate; pedicels 1–40
mm long (only central flowers of triad with pedicels < 1 cm). Flowers sweetly fragrant, often covered with sticky
colleter exudate; ovary and calyx green, corolla, style, stigma, filaments and anthers white; flower bud with obtuse
apex; bracteoles broadly ovate, 3–12 mm long, adaxial surfaces densely sericeous, apices acuminate; hypanthium
2–3.5 mm long; calyx tube 4–8 mm long, adaxial surface densely sericeous (no colleters visible without removal of
pubescence); calyx lobes oblong or foliaceous and strongly keeled or triangular and weakly keeled, 2–12 mm long,
often unequal within one flower, adaxial surfaces densely sericeous, apices obtuse or acute; corolla tube 3.5–7.5 cm
long; corolla lobes oblong , 1–2.2 × 0.8–1.5 cm, apices round and shortly apiculate; filaments 1.5–2 mm long,
anthers 3.5–5.5 mm long, sterile apical appendix ca. 0.5 mm long; ovary 4-locular; style exserted from corolla tube
for 5–8 mm, stigma 4-lobed, lobes 2–3,5 mm long. Fruits probably subglobose, ca. 1.5 cm in diam., with persistent
calyx; fruit wall thick; pyrenes 4, ca. 10 × 4 mm, stony; seeds ca. 9 × 3.5 mm.
Habitat:—low altitude humid or sublittoral eastern forest, on laterite; elev. 25–100 m.
Distribution:—On the eastern coast, from ca. 16° to 23° S (provinces Toamasina and Fianarantsoa) (Fig. 5C).
Notes:—I. quadrilocularis is characterized by dense sericeous pubescence on the adaxial surfaces of bracts,
bracteoles and calyx tube. This pubescence is partly visible from the outside and is an easy character to distinguish
I. quadrilocularis from I. lagenifructa. The inflorescence parts are often covered with sticky colleter exudate.
Fruit size and thickness of the fruit wall could not be measured, since the only mature fruit available was
collected in overripe state (s. coll. 13688-SF, P); seed measurements were possible, however.
The specimens from the Fianarantsoa province generally have shorter bracteoles (3–5 mm long vs. 5–12 mm
long), calyx tubes (4–5 mm long vs. 5–8 mm long), calyx lobes [2–4 mm long vs. (2–)4–12 mm long] and corolla
lobes (1–1.5 cm long vs. 1.4–2.2 cm long), with respect to those from the Tomasina province; however, the
character set between the specimens from the two regions is a continuum, and no subspecific ranks are recognized.

MULTILOCULAR IXORA SPECIES IN MADAGASCAR

Habitat:—Eastern lowland humid forest, on clay; elev. 60 m.
Distribution:—Only known from the type locality Vohipeno on the coast in southeastern Madagascar
(province Fianarantsoa) (Fig. 5D).
Phenology:—flowers: November; fruits: unknown.
Vernacular names:—jorojoro; soaravy.
Notes:—This species is only known from the type collection found in 1952. It was never recorded or collected
afterwards. It occurs in lowland humid eastern forest, a vegetation type that is heavily deforested. The remaining
forest cover is under intense pressure, degraded and fragmented. It is highly probable that I. trimera is currently
extinct. Nevertheless, there have been astounding rediscoveries of species thought extinct in Madagascar, such as
the genus Lathraeocarpa Bremekamp (1957: 160), which was recently rediscovered after more than fifty years
after its description (Groeninckx et al. 2009).
The protologue description (Guédès 1986) does not correspond to the features of the type specimen. Leaves are
cited as up to 21 cm long, whereas the largest ones seen are 15 cm long. The inflorescences are described as
uniflorous and axillary with both peduncle and corolla tubes ca. 6.5 mm long; however, the inflorescences are in
fact terminal and 3–5-florous, the peduncles are 2.5–4 cm long, and the corolla tubes are 5.5–7 cm long.
Since only the type material is available, very few observations on the flowers could be made. Seven flowers
were scored for the number of stigmatic lobes: of these, four have a bilobed stigma, two a 3-lobed stigma and one a
4-lobed stigma. A dissected flower available on the holotype (P) has a specimen with a 3-locular ovary and a thick
ovary wall. While the fruits of I. trimera are not known, the thick ovary wall suggests that the fruit wall may be
massive as well.
Like I. quadrilocularis, this species has a dense sericeous pubescence on the adaxial surfaces of calyx tubes,
bracts and bractoles. No colleters are visible (without removal of pubescence) on the adaxial surface of the calyx
tube.
At first glance, Ixora trimera looks somewhat similar to I. trichocalyx Hochreutiner (1908: 107). Both species
are found on the coast in eastern Madagascar, although I. trichocalyx occurs more to the north (region of
Vatomandry). In both species 2-, 3- and 4-lobed stigmas occur. However, I. trimera differs from this species by the
petioles 0.5–0.8 cm long (vs. 0.8–1.5 cm long), stipular awns ca. 1 mm long (vs. 2–3 mm long), calyx tube 3–4 mm
long (vs. 1–1.5 mm long), calyx lobes (5–)7–11 mm long (vs. 2.5–4.5 mm long), corolla lobes ca. 12 x 10 mm (vs.
ca. 16 x 5–6 mm), filaments 2 mm long (vs. 1 mm long) and thicker ovary wall. Furthermore, Ixora trichocalyx has
2-locular ovaries (Hochreutiner 1908), whereas I. trimera has at least some multilocular ovaries.
