Abstract
The N. micramphora group is erected to accommodate the species N. micramphora, N. abgracilis sp. nov. and N. cid sp.
nov. from submontane habitats in Mindanao, Philippines. An overview of the genus in the Philippines is presented in the
context of recent discoveries. The greater taxonomic importance of pitcher characters over those of the flowers in the
genus is reviewed and hypotheses are provided to account for this phenomenon.
Key words: conservation, Critically Endangered, IUCN, Surigao Province, taxonomy, ultramafic

Introduction
This paper is part of the research towards a World Monograph of Nepenthes Linnaeus (1753: 955), building
on a Skeletal Revision of Nepenthes (Jebb & Cheek 1997) and the Flora Malesiana account (Cheek & Jebb
2001).
Nepenthes is the only genus of Nepenthaceae Dumort. and includes taxa mainly distributed in Malesia
(ca. 125 species), while ca. 12 species occur in Madagascar, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, NE India, Indochina,
Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Australia. Cheek & Jebb (2001) recorded 87 species of Nepenthes, but
since 2001, 54 new specific names have been published in the genus (see IPNI 2013 continuously updated)
and others have been resurrected from synonymy. The number of species currently accepted is 140 and is set
to rise further.
Cheek & Jebb (2001) recorded 12 species in the Philippines. New field surveys and herbaria examinations
allowed discovery of 16 new species that have been published in the last twelve years (see IPNI 2013
continuously updated, e.g. Heinrich et al. 2009, Cheek 2011, Cheek & Jebb 2013a, 2013b, 2013c, 2013d).
Some taxa [e.g. Nepenthes alzapan Jebb & Cheek (2013b: 59)] are considered possibly extinct since the
destruction of forest habitat in the Philippines over the last 100 years has been so extensive. Although the
Philippines is thought to have remained two-thirds forested as recently as 1925 according to Sohmer & Davis
(2007), 75 years after that date Myers et al. (2000) estimated that remaining primary vegetation in the
Philippines amounted to only 3%. Lowland primary forest has now all but gone from the Philippines (Sohmer
& Davis 2007). They define lowland forest as occurring below 500 m a.s.l. Sohmer & Davis (2007) estimate
species extinction levels due to habitat destruction as 9−28% in one representative, mainly forest genus,
Psychotria Linnaeus (1759: 929) (Rubiaceae). Since habitat destruction continues in the Philippines, it is a
race against time to discover, publish, assess and draw attention to the conservation needs of species before
they become extinct, if they have not already been lost.

About 50% of the Nepenthes species in the Philippines occur or occurred in scrub or stunted forest
habitats on ultramafic substrates (both lowland and submontane), while the remaining 50% occur mainly in
submontane forest (500–2000 m a.s.l) on non-ultramafic, mainly volcanic substrates. Species diversity is
highest on Mindanao island, the southernmost and second largest island, followed by Palawan island.
All Philippine Nepenthes species are endemic, except for N. mirabilis (Loureiro 1790: 606) Druce (1916:
637) which is known from Tawi Tawi island (near Borneo), and from the northern coast of Mindanao and its
associated islands. Concerning Nepenthes, and from the phytogeographical point of view, Palawan has closer
affinities with Borneo rather than with the rest of the Philippines (Cheek & Jebb 1999).
Most of the endemic species can be assigned to one of three main groups:
1)

2)

3)

The Nepenthes villosa group (sensu Cheek & Jebb 1999), including taxa with petiolate leaves, welldeveloped lid columns, peristomes with blade-like teeth, and lids which lack a basal appendage. These
taxa are restricted to higher altitude ultramafic habitats and are most diverse in Palawan, but extend to
NE Borneo (Cheek & Jebb 1999).
The N. ventricosa group (sensu Cheek & Jebb 2013b). Its species lack a petiole, have broadly
subcylindrical pitchers with a broad peristome which is conspicuously toothed on its inner edge, lids
which lack appendages, and transversely elliptic nectar glands except along the midline band. They
occur in both ultramafic and non-ultramafic, mainly submontane forest habitats and are most diverse in
the Philippines (but absent from Palawan), extending to New Guinea and to Borneo (Cheek & Jebb
2013b).
The Nepenthes alata group (sensu Cheek & Jebb 2013d). Its species have winged petioles, lids with
basal ridges, usually producing appendages, and upper pitchers usually broadest at the base, and occurs
in the same range of habitats as the N. ventricosa group. It is most diverse in Mindanao, and is endemic
to and extends throughout the Philippines except Palawan, (Cheek & Jebb 2013d).

Nepenthes philippinensis Macfarlane (1908: 43) (endemic to Palawan), part of the N. hirsuta Hooker f.
(1873: 99) group (restricted to Borneo; sensu Cheek & Jebb 1999: 890–891) and N. abalata Jebb & Cheek
(2013: 153) (that occurs in the small low-lying, drier islands between Palawan and Panay Islands) are separate
from the morphological point of view and they cannot be included in the groups above presented. Finally, N.
micramphora V.Heinrich, S.McPherson, Gronemeyer & Amoroso (2009: 1315) (from the extreme SE of
Mindanao) which has been of uncertain placement is discussed in the present paper.
Many of the Philippine Nepenthes species are only known from a single, sometimes sterile, specimen.
However, there are few doubts that they are distinct taxa since the most important species-diagnostic
characters in the genus are the morphology, anatomy and the size of the pitchers (especially the uppers and the
intermediates), while the flowers and the fruit features have less taxonomic value. In many other plant groups,
evolution of character diversity in floral characters appears to be correlated with assisting pollination, often by
a single or few insect species. In Nepenthes, cross-pollination appears from initial studies to be performed by
a broad range of generalist Diptera and Hymenoptera (Lian 1995, Adam 1998). Perhaps for this reason there
is comparatively little species-level differentiation florally in the family. In contrast, evidence has been
steadily accumulating in recent years that the pitchers of different Nepenthes species are specialised at
gathering nutrients from one of a variety of animal sources. They are not always pitfall trappers of any prey
item that happens to fall in, as had previously been assumed. N. mirabilis studied by Jebb (1991) in New
Guinea predominantly trapped ants, but also a spectrum of other insects, while N. albomarginata T.Lobb ex
Lindley (1849: 580) traps almost exclusively a species of termite (Clarke, 1997). N. hemsleyana Macfarlane
(1908: 61), the pitchers of which, providing day roosts for a species of bat, benefit from the resulting faecal
deposits produced (Grafe et al. 2011). No doubt in future, the morphological and micromorphological
character states seen in the pitchers of other Nepenthes species or species groups, will also be shown to be
important to targeting hitherto unsuspected specialised animal nutrient sources.

In the last few cases, the morphological modifications of the pitcher each appear to target only one or two
species of animal. However, it is possible that future studies will show that some or most species of Nepenthes
trap a wider range of insect species available in their environment. Since the range of e.g. arthropod species
can be expected to vary from one mountain (or other geographic location) to another, it is possible that
speciation in Nepenthes might be driven by modifications of the pitcher caused by selection for efficiency in
trapping, or otherwise targeting, the spectra of animal species present at each. This might explain the common
pattern seen in several Nepenthes groups to have different species, as recognised by pitcher morphology and
micromorphology, on different mountains or islands.
An alternative hypothesis to explain this speciation pattern is genetic drift (Stace 1991). In this hypothesis,
the progeny of the few founding individuals at a new location might accumulate morphological changes over
time, that are not related to selection pressures. This scenario assumes that animal targeting is not strongly
selected for in Nepenthes. This might be the case if the threshold for the need for nutrients derived from
animals in Nepenthes is very low, or if there is no threshold at all, for example if Nepenthes can survive
without capturing animal nutrients through their pitchers.
The shape and dimensions of the upper and intermediate pitchers and their structures are taxonomically
highly useful characters, including those of the body, mouth and lid of the pitcher, and of the fringed wings
when present. The nectar glands on the lower surface (size, shape, orientation, position, number per area unit,
presence/absence of the nectar gland perimeter wall) of the lid are especially important as species characters.
Trichome complements on the pitchers, leaves and stems are often important for species delimitation
especially in the Nepenthes alata group. Here the trichome classification of Cheek & Jebb (2001: 7–8) is
maintained.

Materials and Methods
Herbarium specimens (codes for herbaria are according to Thiers 2011 continuously updated) and living plants
were examined. In several cases the mouth and the lid surface are not well visible in herbarium specimens, so
it was necessary to soak the mouth area and lid, or sometimes the entire pitchers, in warm soapy water.
The following characters were measured: stem, and leaf and pitcher (using a graduated rule), hair sizes,
and peristome and lower lid details (using a binocular microscope with an eyepiece graticule graduated in
units of 0.025 mm at X40 magnification).

Results and discussion
The two species here described, N. abgracilis and N. cid, do not fit in any of the species-groups known from
the Philippines (see introduction). Although they appear similar to the N. alata group, they lack the basal ridge
and appendage of the lower surface of the lid. On the other hand, there is a clear morphological affinity with
N. micramphora (described from Mindanao). Therefore, we here propose a new and informal species group
named the “N. micramphora group”, the diagnostic characters of which are:

McPherson & Gronemeyer (2008: 36, 38) and McPherson (2009: 638 & fig. 343) published detailed
photographs of a range of variants of N. alata. One of these images was indicated as “A spectacular variant of
N. alata growing on Mt Legaspi in the north of Mindanao. Note the lack of an appendage on the underside of
the lid”. The lack of a lid appendage, and the lack of the leaf petiole (viewed in image), indicates that the plant
represented by these photographs cannot be included in the N. alata group (sensu Cheek & Jebb 2013d).
Moreover, the taxon cannot be identified as any of the known Nepenthes species. Concerning the pitcher
features, the lids appear elliptic with base rounded, not cordate, and the lid nectar glands are large, dense and
uniform over the entire lower surface including the midline; the short column has holes, not teeth, on the inner
edge of the uniform cylindrical peristome; the slightly swollen, ellipsoid pitcher base narrows very slightly to
a waist above, then dilates towards the peristome.
We found a specimen at K matching the photographs by McPherson & Gronemeyer (2008) and
McPherson (2009). The label includes Merrill’s annotation “seems only to answer to a large form of N.
gracilis. With sheet no. 34501 of N. merrilliana alt. 670m, Surigao, Mindanao, April 1919, Ramos &
Pascasio”. Merrill's observation that this specimen is a form of N. gracilis was logical. It evidently refers to
the apetiolate, subamplexicaul leaf-blade and subglabrous state of the material which, together with the
subcylindrical pitcher, with its narrowly cylindrical peristome and ovate-elliptic, unappendaged lid, are
characters seen in N. gracilis Korthals (1840: 22). Until recently this combination of characters was unknown
in the Philippines. However, recently a species has been described from Mindanao with these N. gracilis
characters, this being N. micramphora. Our material, described below as N. abgracilis, can be distinguished
from N. micramphora and N. gracilis as shown in table 1 below.

spirally inserted, coriaceous, apetiolate, narrowly oblanceolate-oblong, 23.2–29 × 2.6–3.1 cm, apex attenuate,
base gradually attenuate to ca. 1.3 cm wide at base, clasping the stem for 3/4 to 4/5 its circumference, at an
acute angle from the vertical, forming wings 0.3–0.4 cm wide and extending 0.9–1.2 cm below the leaf axil;
longitudinal nerves 3–4 pairs on each side of the midrib in the outer ¾ of the blade, arising from the leaf base
and along the midrib, visible only on adaxial surface; pennate nerves not visible, upper surface dark green,
lower surface drying brown, moderately densely scattered with sessile glands as the stem, hairs absent. Lower
and intermediate pitcher unknown. Upper pitchers (tendrils coiled) subcylindric ca. 16.4 cm × 5.5 cm,
broadest at the slightly ellipsoid base, gradually and slightly constricting to 4.1 cm wide at the centre, before
dilating to 5 cm wide below the peristome, outer surface yellow-green, with sessile glands as the stem, 3–4 per
mm², hairs absent except a few inconspicuous simple hairs 0.05–0.10 mm long near peristome; fringed wings
reduced to ridges running the length of the pitcher. Mouth ovate, ca. 6 × 4 cm, oblique; peristome cylindric,
ca. 2.5 mm wide, red, faintly lobed, to 4 mm wide, 2 ridges per mm, ridges 0.1 mm high, inner and outer edges
tightly in-rolled, teeth not visible; column short, not strongly developed, with holes visible at the inner edge;
lid ovate-elliptic, ca. 5.2 × 4 cm, apex rounded to truncate, base rounded at base; lower surface suffused or
blotched red, lacking an appendage, but with a basal ridge (probably an artefact of drying), ca. 10 mm long, 1
mm, flat-topped; nectar glands more than 100, 95% or more monomorphic and relatively uniform in size,
orbicular or slightly elliptic, 0.6–0.75(–0.9) × 0.4–0.5 mm, including a narrow rim ca. 0.05 mm wide; the
basal ridge upper surface with circa 20 narrowly elliptic-oblong glands 0.75 × 0.25 mm; glands at the junction
of blade with peristome, deeply sunken, lacking a rim, ca. 0.25 mm diam.; sessile glands as on stem evident
only at the edge of the lid, few and inconspicuous; spur entire. Inflorescence and fruit unknown.
Distribution & habitat:—Philippines, Mindanao, Surigao Province. Forested submontane ridges,
probably ultramafic, 670 m a.s.l.
Etymology:—The epithet abgracilis means ”from gracilis” referring to the type specimen that was early
identified by Merrill (see above) as a form of the species of that name.
Conservation status:—Nepenthes abgracilis is here assessed as Critically Endangered, under Criterion
D of IUCN (2012). A single location is currently known (NE Mindanao). Although mining for metal ore
occurs at the Mt Legaspi location, this is so far at lower altitudes than the species is known to occur
(McPherson 2009). However, recent logging in Mindanao may have resulted in the extinction in the wild of
one species recently (Cheek 2011). It is hoped that further observations will show that N. abgracilis is more
common and widespread than present data suggest.

narrowing gradually and slightly about the middle to ca. 1.6 cm wide before widening slightly to the
peristome, outer surface 10–30% covered in minute, 4–5-armed, stellate hairs 0.1 mm diam., mixed with
sparse minute simple hairs and larger basally branched hairs 0.4 mm long, together with depressed globose

slightly denser along the midline and more diffuse at the margin; red sessile peltate or depressed-globose
glands 0.05 mm diam., scattered evenly; marginal areas with minute inconspicuous branched hairs. Spur
simple, tapering from base to apex, acute, 4–5 mm long, moderately to densely hairy. 10–20% covered in
simple hairs 0.2 mm long. Inflorescence and Infrutescence unknown.
Etymology:—The specific epithet is dedicated to the collector of the type specimen, F. Cid (fl. 1952) of
the Herbarium of the Department of Botany, University of the Philippines.
Distribution & ecology:—Philippines, Mindanao, Bukidnon; lower submontane forest, on tall trees.
Elevation 770 m.
Conservation:—Nepenthes cid is currently known from one location in a country where most of the
original forest habitat has been cleared for timber and agricultural land (Myers et al. 2000) and where forest
degradation and clearance are ongoing. Intensive industrial pineapple plantations extending SE along the
valley from Cagayan de Oro appear to be the main pressure on natural habitat at the type locality, as viewed
on GoogleEarth (viewed 2 Oct. 2013). The population found include less than ten individuals (two), so N. cid
is here assessed as Critically Endangered under Criterion D of IUCN (2012). It is hoped that additional
locations for this species will be found and that one or more can be protected to ensure the survival of this
species. However it is a concern that despite much searching by many enthusiasts in the last 10 years,
including in the Bukidnon area (e.g. McPherson 2009), this species has not been collected in the last 60 years.
This span corresponds with the peak period of forest destruction in the Philippines (Sohmer & Davis 2007). It
is possible that N. cid is already globally extinct.
Notes:—Excepting for Nepenthes cid, and N. truncata Macfarlane (1911: 209), all other species of
Nepenthes known from Mindanao are mainly terrestrial, although a few can sometimes root on the base of
trunks of stunted trees in mossy forest on mountain peaks. However, examples of high epiphytes such as N.
cid, on tall trees in lower submontane forest (700 m a.s.l) are rarer. Potentially N. cid could be more common
than the sparsity of the existing material indicates, but due to its inaccessibility on tall trees is rarely seen.
Nepenthes cid remains incompletely known to science. Botanists in Mindanao are urged to search for this
species to establish whether or not it survives, to reveal its full range and to obtain collections with
inflorescences, thus far unknown.
