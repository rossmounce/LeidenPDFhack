Abstract
A new tapered and false branched morphotype of filamentous heterocytous cyanobacterium was isolated from soil
material collected on a massif of Chirripó Mountain, Costa Rica. The strain was analyzed morphologically and a
sequence of its 16S rRNA gene was compared with available 16S rDNA sequences of organisms with similar
morphology, especially those with heteropolar tapering filaments. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the strain was
significantly different from Rivulariaceae, but was closely related to several strains designated as Tolypothrix. However,
according to the original descriptions in the literature, members of the genus Tolypothrix possess only very slightly
tapering filaments. With regard to all these differences, we decided to describe a new genus—Calochaete gen. nov. with
type species C. cimrmanii.

Introduction
Mesoamerica and the Caribbean region are listed among the world’s biodiversity hotspots and are known for
their large number of endemic vertebrates and plant species (Myers et al. 2000). However, there is no reason
to not extend this biodiversity to organisms much smaller and not so easily visible such as algae and
Cyanobacteria. In this sense, the monograph by Gardner (1927), or more recent studies (e.g. Komárek &
Komárková-Legnerová 2007, Kaštovský et al. 2011) that described previously unrecognized cyanobacterial
diversity in the tropical regions of Central and South America, are very valuable.
Within the group of filamentous cyanobacteria with heterocytes (order Nostocales sensu Hoffmann et al.
2005), there are three groups of false branched types. The family Scytonemataceae has isopolar filaments and
tapering can be found in two of the five genera belonging to this group. The families Rivulariaceae and
Microchaetaceae are both characterized by heteropolar filaments; tapered types are included in the family
Rivulariaceae, as tapering was traditionally considered the fundamental difference between these two families
(Komárek & Anagnostidis 1989). The only known exception to date is Godleya alpina Novis et Visnovsky
(2011: 14), which is distinctly tapered, but was classed to Microchaetaceae based on molecular markers.
In the course of a broader study on the floristics of aerophytic cyanobacteria of the San Gerardo de Rivas
region, San José, Costa Rica (Mühlsteinová 2011), a new morphotype of a heterocytous cyanobacterium was
found and isolated into a unicyanobacterial strain. The aim of this study was to characterize this unusual type
using a combination of morphological and molecular data (referred to as the polyphasic approach). By
recognizing and describing our isolate as a species new to science, our study contributes to knowledge about
the species richness of one of the planet’s biodiversity hotspots. Concurrently, we discuss the heterogeneity of
the family Microchaetaceae in the current concept.

Material and methods
A soil crust in the “páramo” ecosystem was collected in March 2010 at 9° 29’ 58” N, W 83° 30’ 24” W along
the trail from San Gerardo de Rivas to the summit of Chirripó Mountain (3820 m a.s.l.), Costa Rica, at an
elevation around 3600 m a.s.l. The sample was dried in silicagel in the field and dilution plated on agar
solidified Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM, Bischoff & Bold 1963) upon return to the laboratory. A single clonal
colony was then isolated and cultivated on BBM and Z8 (Kotai 1972) agar slants at 16 and 22 °C in a 12:12
light:dark cycle. To record the phases of the life cycle, the culture was examined at 14 days, 7 months, and 15
months after inoculation. Observations were performed using an Olympus BX 51 microscope equipped with
Nomarski DIC optics; photographs were taken using an Olympus DP 71 digital camera.
Molecular analyses:—For phylogenetic analyses, a gene for the small subunit of ribosomal RNA (16S
rRNA) was chosen. This marker, traditionally used for prokaryotic organisms, is convenient for comparisons
on various taxonomic levels due to it containing both highly conserved and variable regions (e.g. Woese &
Fox 1977, Nelissen et al. 1996, Chakravorty et al. 2007). Moreover, compared to other phylogenetic markers,
a sufficient number of 16S rDNA sequences of various cyanobacteria are available in public databases,
providing a good foundation for placement of unusual taxon in the tree of life. Approximately 1 mm3 of the
strain biomass was dried for 48 hours in silicagel and pulverized with wolfram carbide beads in a Retsch
MM200 mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) for 3 minutes. Total genomic DNA was isolated following the
protocol of Yilmaz et al. (2009). A ~1600 bp segment of the rRNA operon containing partial SSU rRNA gene
and the ITS region was amplified using primer 1 (5’-CTC TGT GTG CCT AGG TAT CC-3’) after Wilmotte
et al. (1993), and primer 2 ( 5’-GGG GAA TTT TCC GCA ATG GG-3’) after Nübel et al. (1997), as
previously described in detail by Boyer et al. (2001). 10 ng of template DNA were mixed with 6 pmol of each
primer in a commercial PCR mix with Taq polymerase (Plain PP Master Mix, Top Bio, Czech Republic), and
amplified with an initial denaturation step (5 minutes at 95 °C) followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (1 min
at 94 °C), primer annealing (45 s at 55 °C), elongation (2 min at 72 °C), and final extension for 10 min at 72
°C. The PCR product was cloned using the standard pGEM-T Easy vector system (Promega Corp., WI, USA)
according to the supplied manual. Plasmids containing insert were purified with Zyppy Plasmid Miniprep kit
(Zymo Research Corp., CA, USA). The clones were sequenced using standard plasmid primers T7 (5’-TAA
TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GG-3’) and SP6r (5’-TAT TTA GGT GAC ACT ATA G-3’) on ABI PRISM 3130
XL (Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corp., CA, USA) in the Laboratory of Genomics, Biology Centre
of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. The sequence was deposited in the European Nucleotide
Archive (EMBL/ENA, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/) under accession number HF912386.
Phylogenetic analyses:—Obtained sequences were aligned using MAFFT v. 6 (Katoh et al. 2009)
together with 67 selected OTUs representing the heterocytous cyanobacteria obtained from GenBank
(February 2013), and two outgroup taxa (Blennothrix sp. AQS and Chroococcidiopsis thermalis Geitler
(1933: 625) strain PCC 7203). Phylogenetic calculations were run employing Bayesian inference in MrBayes
3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2011), maximum likelihood analysis, and neighbor-joining BioNJ algorithm in SeaView
4.4 (Gouy et al. 2010). For the Bayesian analyses, two runs of eight Markov chains were executed for ~1
million generations with default parameters, sampling every 100 generations (the final average standard
deviation of split frequencies was lower than 0.01), and the first 25% of sampled trees were discarded as burnin. The maximum likelihood calculation was executed on the generalized time-reversible (GTR) substitution
model with discrete gamma distribution in six categories. The gamma shape parameter as well as the
proportion of invariable sites were estimated from the data set (GTR + + I model), and 1000 bootstrap
replicate searches were conducted to evaluate the relative support of branches. The neighbor-joining analysis
was run on the Hasegawa, Kishina and Yano (HKY) substitution model with 1000 bootstrap replicates. The
secondary structures of ITS helices were folded using sFold (Ding et al. 2004).

Results
Class Cyanophyceae
Order Nostocales
Family Microchaetaceae
Calochaete Hauer, Bohunická & Mühlsteinová, gen. nov.
Colony on agar dark green or brown, amorphous. Filaments usually very long with basal heterocyte, swollen
at the base, then gradually tapering towards the end, without terminal hair, often with false branching, single
or double. Sheath 0.5–1.5 µm thick, unstructured, colorless. Trichomes notably constricted at cross-walls, 7–9
µ m wide at the base and 3.0–4.3 µ m wide at well-developed ends. Cells olive green, brown to violet,
cylindrical or barrel shaped, shorter or longer than wide, 3–8 µm long, basal:apical ratio 1.8–2. Terminal cell
longer than wide, cylindrical or bluntly conical. Heterocytes basal or intercalary, green to yellowish,
hemispherical or cylindrical, rarely conical, 4–7 µm wide, 4–8 µm long. Reproduction by hormogonia with
almost spherical cells. No akinetes were observed.
Type species: Calochaete cimrmanii Hauer, Bohunická & Mühlsteinová.
Etymology:—From the Greek Kalos (beatutiful) and chaete (long hair), refers to one of the
morphological features.
Calochaete cimrmanii Hauer, Bohunická & Mühlsteinová, sp. nov. (Figs 1A–P)
The description corresponds to that of the genus.

Type:—COSTA RICA. Chirripó Mountain slope, 9° 29’ 58” N, 83° 30’ 24” W, surface soil in páramo, dried
specimen from culture of sample, colle. M. Bohunická and J. Mareš, 6 March 2010 (holotype: CBFS! A–015).
Type strain: CCALA 1012.
Habitat:—Surface soil in “páramo” (tropical high montane vegetation).
Etymology:—The species is named after the mythical Czech scientist, dramatist, poet, and writer Jára
Cimrman.
Observations:—The life cycle contains several morphologically distinct stages (Fig. 1). One was
described above, i.e long, gradually tapering, heteropolar filaments (Figs 1A, B, P). The second consists of
hormogonia composed of short, isodiametric, barrel-shaped to spherical cells resembling in morphology
Nostoc Vaucher ex Bornet et Flahault (1888: 181) types lacking the sheath (Fig. 1E). Some cells within the
hormogonia grow in size and change their shape to spherical (Figs 1D, O). Cells may sometimes divide in
more than one plane (Figs 1L, M, O), but never form a true branch. A new filament then germinates from the
hormogonia (Fig. 1C). The first cell of the filament becomes a heterocyte. The hormogonia with large
spherical cells (e.g. Fig. 1D) occur in young cultures only.
Our strain differs from the morphologically similar genus Calothrix Agardh ex Bornet et Flahault (1886:
345) by the absence of a terminal hair and frequent false single or double branching (Figs 1G, H, N). As
notable from Fig. 2, the 16S rRNA sequence of Calochaete cimrmanii is very distant from members of
Rivulariaceae and is more related to Microchaetaceae. The most similar are sequences of Tolypothix strains
UAM 332, 334, 337 and PCC 7504, but the degree of tapering is significantly lower in these strains. The low
degree of tapering itself is one of the key diacritical features of the genus Tolypothrix Kützing ex Bornet et
Flahault (1887: 118), which is accepted in both the botanical (Komárek & Anagnostidis 1989) and
bacteriological (Castenholz 2001) literatures. From the above mentioned Tolypothrix strains, Calochaete
cimrmanii differs also by living in a significantly different –non-aquatic, high mountain– habitat.

Comparison of the secondary structures of 16S-23S ITS is of taxonomic importance according to
Johansen et al. (2011). To illustrate specificity and the rate of relatedness of the different morphologically
similar taxa included in our study, we provide the two most conserved ITS domains, the D1-D1’ and Box-B
helices for Calochaete cimrmanii, Tolypothrix sp. PCC 7504 from cluster “B”, Spirirestis rafaelensis

7507 from a cluster phylogenetically distant from Calochaete (Fig. 3). It can be clearly seen that Calochaete
cimrmanii and Tolypothrix PCC 7504 are significantly similar in both structures, especially in the basal parts
and the bottom halves of the loops (Figs 3A, B, E, F). Concurrently, there are obvious differences in the top
portions of the loops, supporting our decision to separate Calochaete from the traditional genus Tolypothix.
The similarity of the secondary structures decreases when comparing Calochaete with Spirirestis as a
representative of cluster “A” and the most phylogenetically but supposedly morphologically related
Calothrix.

Discussion
We performed a detailed study of an unusual strain isolated from a terrestrial habitat at high elevation in Costa
Rica. Many authors, e.g. Berrendero et al. (2011), pointed out changes in morphology of cyanobacterial
strains after transfer from nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor cultivation media. To document the variability in the
strain morphology under different conditions, we used two different cultivation media—BBM and Z8. We
also observed the culture in different stages of the life cycle from very young colonies 14 days after the
inoculation growing in high light intensities and 22 °C (exponential growth phase), up to cultures 15 months
old kept at 16 °C and dim conditions (stationary growth phase). We were not able to detect changes in
morphology between clones cultivated in different media and the diacritical features remained stable also
under different environmental conditions (temperature, light) and the age of the culture. As mentioned above,
a stage of short isopolar hormogonia with several enlarged cells dividing in two planes occurred in young
cultures of our strain. Similar structures were already reported in Westiellopsis prolifica Janet (1941: 170), and
later in Rexia erecta Casamatta, Gomez et Johansen (2006: 23).
Discrepancies between morphological and molecular data, as shown above, were reported before. An
example of the same phenomenon was noted by Novis & Visnovsky (2011) describing the cyanobacterial
genus Godleya Novis et Visnovsky (2011: 14). The type strain possesses an important diacritical feature of
Scytonemataceae—isopolar development of the trichomes, but the 16S rDNA sequence is more similar to
heteropolar Coleodesmium Geitler (1942:154) strain ANT.LH52B.5.
The presented phylogenetic tree reveals also another fact: the obvious polyphyly in the genus Tolypothrix
and consequently in the whole family Microchaetaceae. Two sequences of strains designated as T. distorta
Kützing ex Bornet et Flahault (1887: 119), the type of the genus according to CyanoDB.cz (Komárek & Hauer
2013), and one as T. tenuis Kützing ex Bornet et Flahault (1887: 122) fall in a well-supported cluster (Fig. 2,
cluster A) with Spirirestis rafaelensis, another member of the family Microchaetaceae. Other sequences of
strains designated as Tolypothrix, e.g. Tolypothrix PCC 7415, PCC 7504, UAM 337, or Microchaete
diplosiphon Gomont ex Bornet et Flahault (1886: 211) strain CCALA 811, form a distant and also well
supported cluster (Fig. 2, cluster B), where C. cimrmanii is a basal group. This disunity of the family was
denoted already in work of Berrendero et al. (2011), where the authors distinguished two subclusters of
Microchaetaceae. We propose that the family Microchaetaceae as currently concieved does not exist and
further analyses of strains of its members are necessary. Obviously, the same revision awaits also the
Rivulariaceae family.

Conclusions
We have described a new cyanobacterial genus from a “páramo” zone of Chirripó Mountain, Costa Rica. Our
results clearly show the need for taxonomic revision of the families Microchaetaceae and Rivulariaceae.
