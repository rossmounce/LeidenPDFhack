Abstract
Male organs and mature sporophytes of a calciphilous moss previously known as Horikawaea dubia are newly reported
and described in detail based on a single specimen collected in Guangxi Province, southern China. Sporophytic features,
such as the immersed and cylindrical capsule on a very short seta (ca. 1.2 mm long) and reduced peristome with 16
smooth and almost linear exostome teeth, as well as the gametophytic resemblance to Cryptogonium phyllogonioides in
having complanate foliation, highly differentiated alar region of the stem and branch leaves, and more or less cucullate
leaf apices, suggest a new synonymy of Horikawaea in Cryptogonium. Two new combinations, namely, C. dubia (Tixier)
H.Akiyama & B.C.Tan comb. nov. and C. nitida (Nog.) H.Akiyama & B.C.Tan comb. nov. are made. Additionally,
Pseudocryptogonium H.Akiyama & B.C.Tan gen. nov. is proposed to accommodate Horikawaea tjibodensis (syn. H.
redfearnii).
Key words: Bryopsida, China, mosses, Malesia, taxonomy

Introduction
In the course of examining bryophyte collections from limestone areas in the southern part of China (Guangxi
Province) in 1997, two specimens of Horikawaea dubia (Tixier) S.H.Lin were found. One of them bore male
gametangia and mature sporophytes, both of which were unknown for the species. They are newly described
here as follows.

Description
Sexual organs and sporophytes of Horikawaea dubia (Figures 1–16)
Dioicous? (at least, perichaetia and perigonia produced on different ascending stems). Perigonia lateral on
ascending stems, bud-like; antheridia ca. 10 in number, long-pedicellate, 70–80 µ m long, paraphyses
filamentous, ca. 20 in number, to 0.7 mm long, longer than the length of antheridia. Perigonial leaves ovoid,
shortly acuminate, concave, ecostate, ca. 1 mm long, yellowish green above, reddish brown at base; median
laminal cells linear-rhomboid, smooth, ± thick-walled; basal laminal cells rectangular, thick-walled and pitted.
Perichaetia lateral on ascending stems; archegonia 7–20 in number; paraphyses filamentous, fewer than
archegonia in number. Perichaetial leaves oblong-ovate, ca. 1 mm long, incurved, ecostate, yellowish green
above, reddish brown at base, becoming much longer after fertilization and reaching 7 mm long; upper and
median laminal cells linear-rhomboid, smooth, ± thick-walled; basal laminal cells much differentiated,
rectangular, thick-walled and pitted. Calyptrae cucullate, densely papillose, naked.

Seta short, ca. 1.2 mm long, yellow, smooth. Capsules deeply immersed among perichaetical leaves,
cylindrical, to 3 mm long, not constricted below the mouth, weakly plicate at base when dry; columella
absent; exothecial cells hexagonal, smooth; stomata absent; opercula conic or shortly rostrate, falling with
calyptrae; annuli not seen. Peristome single, pale yellow, with weakly developed properistome; exostome
teeth linear, 16, slightly inserted below the rim, sometimes adnate to each other and becoming paired, to 280
µm tall, smooth on both surfaces, sometimes perforate proximally, dorsal trabeculae thin, low and distant,
ventral trabeculae thick and broad; closed when wet, open and recurved when dry. Spores spherical, light
brown and thin-walled, greenish inside, minutely papillose, 25–30 µm in diameter, about half in a single spore
sac highly shrunken.
Specimens examined:—CHINA. Guangxi: Baise City, Nabao county, between Nabao (23.4058°N,
105.8406°E) and Ping Meng (22.9333°N, 105.8333°E), Mt. Qui-Kan-Shan, 1060–1160 m elev., limestone
area, on tree trunk in a well preserved, moist secondary forest, 1997 Oct. 19, H. Akiyama China-1335 (HYO!),
with sporophytes; ibid., in the vicinity of Nabao, Mt. Longli, 1000–1200 m elev., on limestone boulder and
shrub branches, 1997 Oct. 22, H. Akiyama China-1386 (HYO!).
Differences of sporophytes between Horikawaea and Cryptogonium
Sporophytic features of Cryptogonium (Müll.Hal.) Hampe have been described in detail by Noguchi
(1961) and Lin (1984a) based on C. phyllogonioides (Sull.) Isov. In addition, the senior author (HA) has
observed sporophytes on the specimens of C. phyllogonioides from Seram Island of Indonesia (see
"specimens examined" below). Characteristic features of the sporophytes are distinctly pilose calyptrae;
capsules constricted just below the mouth; and exostome teeth inserted below the rim. However, other
important features such as peristome morphologies (e.g., number and shape of smooth and linear exostome
teeth, the wide trabeculae on the inner side of the tooth surfaces, and presence of a weak properistome), the
immersed position of the capsule amongst the perichaetial leaves, and the absence of stomata are quite similar
between C. phyllogonioides and Horikawaea dubia (see description above), as well as their shared
gametophytic features such as the cucullate leaf acumen, strong differentiation of alar regions, complanate
foliation, single costa often reaching to the middle of leaf length, Bryum-type of dormant branch primordia
with filamentous pseudoparaphyllia, and septate short gemmae in leaf axils (Lin 1984a, Isoviita 1986,
Akiyama 1990).
When establishing a new genus Pursellia S.H.Lin (treated here as a synonym of Cryptogonium), Lin
(1984a, table 10) pointed out some morphological differences from those of Horikawaea. At that time,
however, no sporophyte was known for Horikawaea.
The present discovery of sporophytes from Horikawea dubia and their resemblance to those of species of
Cryptogonium, as well as their gametophytic similarities, strongly suggest that these two genera are
congeneric. Recent molecular analyses (for example, Cox et al. 2010) are supportive of the cladistic proximity
of these two genera.
The sporophyte of Horikawaea tjibodensis [syn., H. redfearnii B.C. Tan & P.-J. Lin], a species included in
the genus recently by Ji & Enroth (2006) is, however, quite different from that of Horikawaea phyllogonioides
and Horikawaea dubia. According to Tan & Lin (1995) and our confirmation, sporophytes of H. tjibodensis
show the following features: young calyptrae bearing papillae on the surfaces; setae 4–5 mm long, weakly
papillate; capsules (ovoid-oblong, erect, 1–1.5 mm long) highly exserted beyond the perichaetial leaves;
opercula conic to rostrate; stomata present at neck (after Jia 2011); peristome highly reduced; exostome teeth
about 8 in number, deeply inserted below the rim, outer surface weakly striate; spores round to tetrahedral,
24–44 µm in diameter, granulose and chlorophyllose. In addition, there are leaf morphological differences
seen between H. tjibodensis and other congeners as shown in the keys below. We therefore propose a new
genus, Pseudocryptogonium, in the Pterobryaceae to accommodate H. tjibodensis.

Familial affinity of Cryptogonium has been variously proposed by different authors, for example, in the
Neckeraceae, Phyllogoniaceae, or Pterobryaceae. Judging from morphological features, such as septate, short
filamentous gemmae abundantly produced from dormant branch buds in leaf axils, and filamentous
pseudoparaphyllia produced on dormant branch buds, as well as the presence of a reduced properistome,
smooth exostome teeth, and well-developed alar regions of the stem and branch leaves, its placement in the
Pterobryaceae is preferred (Akiyama 1990 and others). In addition, molecular analyses support this familial
treatment [Goffinet et al. (2009), Cox et al. (2010; fig.1-B), Wang et al. (2010; fig. 1)].
All members of Cryptogonium listed below share the following morphological features: (1) more or less
shiny plants with complanate foliation; (2) somewhat cucullate apices of leaves in lateral position on stems
and branches; (3) colored, well differentiated alar cells of leaves with quadrate, markedly pitted cells; (4)
dormant branch buds of AI-type (Akiyama 1990) with a number of short, septate gemmae emerging directly
from the surface of buds; and (5) filamentous pseudoparaphyllia (often branched and 1–2 cells wide at base).

Note. Horikawaea nitida is the type species of the genus Horikawaea Nog. We follow Lin (1984a) who
treated Cryptogonium nitidum ( Horikawaea nitida) and C. dubium ( H. dubia) as two different species and
C. nitidum as a Taiwanese endemic. For more details, see notes under C. dubium. Although the sporophyte of
H. nitida is still not known, we can assume that it will be similar to that observed in H. dubia because of the
strong similarity of their gametophytes and to the extent that the two have been accepted as synonyms by
several researchers [Pócs (1969), Tan & Lin (1995), Ji & Enroth (2006)].

Note. Lin (1984a, table 9) compared the morphological features of Cryptogonium dubium and C. nitidum
(as Horikawaea nitida) in detail and treated them as two distinct species. Luo (1989) and Jia (2011) followed
the treatment. The main differences between the two species are: (1) more slender and shorter plants with
pendent flagelliform branches; (2) small medullary cells of stems with incrassate walls; and (3) strongly
complanate foliation in C. dubium. However, Pócs (1969), Tan & Lin (1995), Ji & Enroth (2006) regarded
these morphological differences as just phenotypic plasticity caused by environmental factors and treated
them as a single variable species. We tentatively treat them as different species here. As shown in the keys
below, C. dubium and C. nitidum can be distinguished by their difference in leaf shape at the dorsal and
ventral position of stems, especially when wet.

Note. In Pseudocryptogonium tjibodensis, the totally naked dormant buds are surrounded by single-celled
wide, unbranched filamentous pseudoparaphyllia. Asexual reproductive organs were not found among the
specimens examined. Molecular phylogenetic analyses including the new genus (as Horikawaea redfearnii)
show a low bootstrap support in a clade with Cryptogonium phyllogonioides, but a close relationship with
members of the family Pterobryaceae (Cox et al. 2010 fig.1-B, Wang et al. 2010, fig.1).
