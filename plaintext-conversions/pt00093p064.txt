Abstract
A new freshwater chrysophyte genus and species, Chrysomorula cohaerens, is described from the United States.
Chrysomorula cohaerens is a distinct taxon of non-motile heterokont chrysophyte. It forms macroscopic mucilaginous
colonies attached to aquatic macrophytes, filamentous algae, and other substrata. Each colony is initially held together
forming a hollow sphere by the confluence of its cell walls. The colony is at first a sphere, becoming ovoid to irregular
with growth in size. Thus, it differs from other similar chrysophyte genera such as Heimiochrysis and Chalkopyxis. Cells
bear pseudocilia.

Introduction
There are numerous genera of golden-brown algae (Chrysophyta, Chrysophyceae) living in freshwater
habitats. Reports of their distribution had been scattered throughout the algal literature for a long time, but
only recently have these been summarized for North America (Nicholls & Wujek 2003). Several more genera
have recently been added: Wujek (2006), Andrews and Wujek (2009), and Nicholls (2013).
This paper reports and describes a new chrysophycean alga Chrysomorula cohaerens from Maryland,
Kansas and Michigan.

Material and methods
Samples containing Chrysomorula cohaerens were collected from the following sites: Maryland (Harford
County, ephemeral pond, Belcamp), Kansas (Douglas County, an I-70 turnpike marsh, west of Lawrence), and
Michigan (Charlevoix County, Greene’s Lake, a Sphagnum-dominated lake on Beaver Island). All collections
were taken in mid-February or May.
Light microscope observations were made with an AO Spencer or Zeiss Photoscope II microscope.
Observations were made both from freshly collected material and from stock cultures grown in Petri dishes
containing soil water extract or Bold’s Basal Medium (Bold 1967) supplemented with additional soil water
extract. Cultures were established by micropipetting portions of epiphytes with the alga remaining attached to
them or by “teasing” the colonies from their substrata and placing them into the culture medium. Cultures
were placed in a north facing window and illuminated using natural light. Material was abundant enough to
permit the observation of a number of characteristics but nothing of the alga’s reproduction, during periods up
to three weeks. Some material was stained with methylene blue or iodine. Culture materials no longer survive.
A sample from the type locality preserved with a 2% acid Lugol’s solution has since evaporated.

Chrysomorula Wujek, gen. nov. (Figs. 1–4)
The cells of each colony are layered up to three deep at the periphery forming a hollow ball. As the colony
grows it forms a jumbled and irregular shape. Colony is within a gelatinous matrix which is of some definition
at the periphery, but arising from it are numerous very fine pseudocilia (faint lines) through a stiff gel.
Pseudocilia are 92–136 µm long. Colonies are initially sessile but may become planktonic after which they
become fragmented. They are up to 250 µm in diameter not including the pseudocilia. Cells are spherical to
irregular. Each possesses one or two chloroplasts yellow-green to a more prevalent golden-brown color. Cells
possess a few to many refractive granules. Zoospores or statospores were not observed.
Type: Chrysomorula cohaerens Wujek.
Etymology:—The genus name Chrysomorula is from the Greek “Chryso” meaning “golden colored” and
the Latin “morula” meaning “hollow sphere of cells”.

Chrysomorula cohaerens Wujek sp. nov. (Figs. 1–4)
Cells are spherical to irregular (somewhat square) by mutual compression, 5.8–6.2 µm in diameter in face view, up to 7
µm long, somewhat in groups of four. Cells possess 1–4 pseudocilia 92–136 µm long. There are one or two goldenbrown (or less commonly yellow-green) parietal chloroplasts per cell. A chrysolaminarin vesicle, median nucleus
and anterior contractile vacuole are prominent cell features. Pseudocilia are stationary and extend to the periphery of
the gelatinous matrix. Reproduction or statospore formation was not observed.
Type:—UNITED STATES. Maryland: under the ice in an ephemeral pond, east of Belcamp, Harford County, 39.4697°
N, 76.2569° W. Sample collected by R.H. Thompson, February 1944. Fig. 1. Typification of the new species is
based on the illustrations hereby published, as it was impossible to preserve specimens showing the features
attributed to the taxon (McNeill et al. 2011, ICN art. 40.5).

Etymology:—The species name cohaerens is from the Latin, meaning “adhering together”.
Remarks:—The genus is distinctive by the nature of its macroscopic colonial habit, with cells forming a
hollow sphere embedded in a matrix, and with pseudocilia extending from each cell to the periphery of the
matrix. New colonies are formed by the fragmentation of the parent colony, often producing plankton forms.
Cell reproduction appears to occur by binary division. Although quite rare, I have observed it primarily
epiphytic on Oedogonium, Microspora, Rhizoclonium, and occasionally Utricularia. Additional USA sites in
which Chrysomorula was observed: An I-70 turnpike marsh, west of Lawrence, Douglas County, Kansas,
May 1966 and Green’s Lake, Beaver Island, Charlevoix County, Michigan, May 1999.

Discussion
The unique generic characters of Chrysomorula separate it from other known chrysophytes that form
gelatinous colonies. When observed with a stereo microscope, the colony appears as a golden nebula. Cells
adhere to one another forming a hollow ball. Compound microscopy shows the cells bearing pseudocilia. The
pseudocilia are also found in a closely related genus Heimiochrysis Bourrelly (1949: 272). However in
Bourrelly’s genus the cells in the colonies form cylindrical, sometimes branched colonies. Cells in the
colonies of Heimiochrysis are arranged in groups of four or eight forming a cylindrical, gelatinous, sometimes

branched tubal-shaped colony. In Chrysomorula, the alga forms a colony held together in the form of a hollow
ball by confluence of cell walls.
Chrysomorula also is excluded from Chalkopyxis Pascher (1931: 102). This genus lacks pseudocilia, the
cells comprising its colony are arranged in groups of two or four, and the outer matrix of the colonies bizoned
mucilage is radially striated.
Chrysomorula’s morphology closely resembles several pseudocilian members of the green algae order
Tetrasporales (e.g. Schizochlamys Braun ex Kützing (1849: 891) and Octosporiella Kugrens (1984: 88)),
aggregate colonies that are nonmotile and often enclosed in a gelatinous matrix. Their most distinctive
character is the presence of long pseudocilia that extend beyond the mucilage. Pseudocilia do not beat and
lack the central pair of microtubules found in normal flagella axonemes (Wujek & Chamber 1965, Lembi &
Herdon 1966). Placed in the Chrysocapsaceae, Chrysomorula is included with those chrysophytes in which
the vegetative cells are without flagella and are united with one another in palmelloid colonies as in the
Tetrasporaceae sensu lato, the homologous family of the Chlorophyceae.
I have no data on the life history of Chrysomorula but from its ephemeral and sporadic appearances in
habitats likely to dry up, I suspect it produces a resting stage such as a stomatocyst. No evidence of
phagotrophy was observed, unlike many other chrysophytes. It is quite possible Chrysomorula may be a
palmella stage of another chrysophyte. One has only to examine the life history of the green alga
Schizochlamys (Thompson 1956: 671) to find several “genera” that were once considered distinct. This
possibility has also been suggested between the chrysophytes Cyclonexis Stokes (1886: 564) and Chrysostephanosphaera Scherffel (1911: 307) as being distinct “genera” within the same taxon (Thompson & Wujek
1998).
