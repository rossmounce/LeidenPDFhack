Abstract
During consideration of fossil centric diatoms from a variety of non-marine localities in the western USA, we
encountered four new species and two previously known taxa that should be assigned to the genus Cyclotella (F.T.
Kützing) A. de Brébisson. We detail the morphological features of these species, and discuss their relevance to other
members of the Cyclotella. These fossil species are studied in light and scanning electron microscopes, and can be
assigned to several morphological groups with respect mainly to the structure of alveolae as well as positon(s) of
rimoportula(e) and marginal fultoportulae. Presence of loculate areolae with internal domed cribra and external
foramina, or both areolae and valve face fultoportulae in the central area are characteristics found in all of these
Cyclotella taxa.

Introduction
The diatom genus Cyclotella (F.T. Kützing) A. de Brébisson (1838: 19) has been investigated intensively with
light and scanning electron microscopy, Gaul et al. (1993) and Henderson and Reimer (2003) document
investigations with electron microscopy on over 165 species, in over 200 papers, were published on the genus
until 2003. Many of the authors who examined multiple species of Cyclotella noted the diversity of forms,
and suggested informal morphological groups (e.g. Lowe 1975; McFarland & Collins 1978; Seriyiessol 1981;
Servant-Vildary, 1986; Loginova, 1990). These works identified a set of criteria on which to establish
morphological groups, including presence and spacing of marginal fultoportulae, presence and spacing of
valve face fultoportulae, presence and number of rimoportulae, presence of spines, other special features such
as granulae and the structure and distribution of striae and alveolae. Loginova (1990) identified 12
morphological groups based on 7 features.
Description of many new taxa have increased our knowledge of the diversity of Cyclotella (e.g. Jousé &
Mukhina 1978; Chen & Zhu 1985; Kling & Håkansson 1988; Loginova 1989; Kozyrenko et al. 1992;
Khursevich et al. 2001; Prasad & Nienow 2006; Khrusevich & Kociolek 2008). More recently, additional
works have proposed new taxa based on this morphological diversity of forms for species assigned originally
to Cyclotella, and genera such as Pliocaenicus Round & Håkannson (1992: 116); Tertiarius Håkannson &
Khursevich (1997: 21) (Khursevich & Kociolek 2002), Puncticulata Håkannson (2002: 21, 112) and
Discostella Houk & Klee (2004: 204–205) were created for taxa previously assigned to Cyclotella.
Investigations of fossil material from Europe (Serieyssol 1981; Servant-Valdary 1986), Asia (Khursevich
et al. 2001; Tanaka 2007) and western North America (Hanna 1932; Khursevich & Kociolek 2008) suggest
the diversity of species assigned to Cyclotella is well represented in the stratigraphic record, extending from
the Middle Eocene (Wolfe & Siver 2009), with a great radiation of species in the Pliocene. Many of the

morphological (not necessarily phylogenetic) groups that have been recognized have representatives, or are
known exclusively, by fossil taxa.
In this report we describe new species that would, in the current understanding of the genus, be referred to
Cyclotella (sensu Houk et al. 2010). We compare these new species with previously described taxa, and
comment on the morphological groups that have been identified within Cyclotella.

Methods and Materials
Our observations are based on primarily on diatomites housed at the Diatom Collection of the California
Academy of Sciences (CAS). We took raw material and mixed it with distilled water, and settled and air-dried
the slurry onto coverslips. The dried material was permanently mounted onto microscope slides with Naphrax
and viewed with a Leica DMRB light microscope with 100X, 1.4NA , DIC optics. For SEM, the dried
material was mounted onto aluminum stubs, sputter coated with gold-palladium, and observations were made
with Leo 1450VP. Samples are archived at the Diatom Collection of the California Academy of Sciences, San
Francisco.

Description:—Valve outline oval-elliptical, sometimes nearly circular, with several girdle bands.
Dimensions of the major axis 8.0–48.0 µm, minor axis 6.5–46.0 µm. Valve surface is divided into two distinct
zones. Central zone oval to elongate, transversely undulate, with irregularly arranged areolae, becoming more
or less radiate, 7–10/ 10 µm in large specimens only. Areolae with internal domed velum and external
foramina. Fultoportulae on the valve face have two to four satellite pores, but those with three satellite pores
are located mainly in the concave part of the valve face internally. Fultoportulae with small aperatures
externally. External valve face is often covered with bumps. Marginal zone extends from 1/3 to 1/2 of the
valve radius, and consists of alveolate striae in fascicles, 7–10/ 10 µm, separated by hyaline interfascicles.
Each fascicle consists of 3–4 parallel or slightly wavy rows of small puncta. Puncta number 40–60 in 10 µm
measured radially, in small specimens. In large specimens, 5–6 puncta at the margin become bi- or triseriate

on the valve face. Striae fascicles are all of the same length. A ring of marginal chambers can be observed
internally. Adjacent chambers are divided by thicker costae. Each chamber encompasses mostly 2 or 3
alveolar openings separated by thinner costae bearing marginal fultoportulae with 3 satellite pores, 4–6/ 10
µm. Externally marginal fultoportulae are represented by short tubes, which are often broken. A single
rimoportula with a slit oriented radially or subradially occurs in association with a thinner costa. The
rimoportula has a small external opening. Spines are irregular in number, being located on the interfascicles
at the margin. Granules occur along the mantle edge.
Cyclotella idahica differs from C. jonesii McLaughlin (1992: 96, figs 1–11; see Figs 70–77 herein) by the
smaller size of the valves, circular or oval valve shape, consistently having valve face fultoportulae, and
having more pronounced bumps and granules on the valve face. Despite these differences, the two species
share many features and appear to have close phylogenetic affinities.

Description:—Valve outline nearly circular, with several girdle bands, 5.0–17.0 µm in diameter. Valve
surface is divided into two distinct zones with different morphologies. The central area is distinctly concave
or convex with irregularly arranged areolae (5 to 17) and one to three valve face fultoportulae. The latter have
three satellite pores internally and open by small aperatures externally. This central zone is separated from the
marginal zone by a wide hyaline ring. Small specimens have simple alveolae. Marginal fultoportulae are
located in small fovae on the gentle slope of costae. A single rimoportula has internal elongated slit and is
positioned within the alveolar opening close to one of the costae. The marginal zone extends from 1/3 to ½ of

Cyclotella discostelliformica differs from C. idahica by its smaller size, presence of strongly concave or
convex central area, external expression of the rimoportula (a distinct slit in C. discostelliformica; a small
circular opening in C. idahica) and the absence of spines.
This new species appears in the light microscope to resemble Discotella stelligera (Cleve & Grunow)
Houk & Klee (2004: 209, figs 23, 24) but differs in the position of the rimoportula and marginal fultoportulae,
(between two costae in D. stelligera and on thinner costae in C. discostelliformica). Moreover, marginal
fultoportulae in C. discostelliformica have three satellite pores; D. stelligera has marginal fultoportulae with
two satellite pores.

areolae. The ribs are thickened and elevated, becoming thinner on the valve mantle. The valve center has enlarged areolae. Scale bars
= 10 and 3 µm, respectively. Figures 53–55, internal valve views. Complex and simple alveolae are positioned around the perimeter of
the valves. Thick and thin costae are evident, and marginal fultoportulae are evident on the recessed costae. Rimportulae are
positioned also on the recessed costae. Areolae with domed cribra are evident in the center of the valves. Scale bars = 3, 2 and 1 µm,
respectively.

Description:—Frustules solitary, round or circular in valve view, 7–100 µm in diameter, short cylindrical
in girdle view with several intercalary bands. Valve face is nearly flat. The valve center has one-several
areolae surrounded by hyaline ring, rarely it is structureless. Central area contains loculate areolae with
internal domed cribra and external foramina, arranged in more or less short radial rows (from 2 to 17 small
areolae in row). Central area fultoportulae have never been observed. The striated zone occupies 1/2 to 3/4 the
length of the valve radius. Striae, 7–12 in 10 µm, are radial, of unequal length, slightly undulate towards the

center of the valve. They consist of two rows of small puncta on the valve face surface and of three-five small
puncta on the valve margin. The striae are divided by costae dichotomously branched from the central area
towards the valve margin. Alveolae are complex and simple. Marginal fultoportulae with three satellite pores
are located on all recessed costae within marginal chambers. They are represented by small openings
externally. One-several raised rimoportulae are positioned also on the recessed costae internally. They are
marked by small round apertures on the external valve surface. Solid conic spines are present irregularly at the
valve face/mantle junction.
Remarks:—Cyclotella stoermeri differs from C. elgeri Hustedt (1952: 374, fig. 31) by the wider striated
zone, the smaller central area, as well as by the different structure and location of marginal fultoportulae (they
have two satellite pores and are placed on all thick costae on the mantle in C. elgeri, while marginal
fultoportulae in C. stoermeri possess three satellite pores and occur only on thin recessed costae). This
species is dedicated to our friend and colleague, Dr. E.F. Stoermer of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Description:—Valves are circular, nearly flat, 10–23 µm in diameter, with a well-defined border between the
central area and the marginal alveolate zone. Central area with a variable number of irregularly arranged
areolae. Marginal zone extending from 1/3 to 1/2 of the valve radius consists of alveolate striae fascicles, 8–
12(14) in 10 µm, separated by hyaline interfascicles or costae. Striae fascicles are of equal length. They
contain 3–4 rows of puncta, 40–60 in 10 µm. Alveoli are simple. Length of alveolar openings is not equal to
the length of striae fascicles. Marginal fultoportulae with 3 satellite pores are located on every second–fourth
costa separating alveolar openings internally. A single rimoportula occurs at one of the costae. Spines are
present at the junction of the valve face and mantle at every interfascicle or costa.
Remarks:—Cyclotella pseudokansasica is similar to C. kansasica in the structure of alveolae, in the
location of rimoportula and marginal fultoportulae, but differs by the absence of one more or less welldeveloped depression at the center, as well as by the shorter length of alveolar openings as compared with the
length of striae fascicles.

We observed two morphotypes in populations we examined. They are almost exactly the same except for
size and valve outline. We present descriptions for both morphotypes even though at this time we recognize
them as the same taxon, C. jonesii.
Morphotype 1 (Figs 70, 72, 73, 75)
Description:—Valve outline rhomboid to ellipsoid, but large forms are nearly circular. Major axis is 20
to 95 µm, minor axis 11 to 93 µm. Central area is elongated, asymmetrically undulate with the depressed
portion shallower than the rise of the elevated part. Central area occupies 1/3 to 1/2 of the total valve face and
contains areolae arranged in more or less radial rows. Valve face fultoportulae are absent. Striae number 7–9/
10 µm, consisting of 2–3 rows of small puncta (with up to 30 puncta in 10 µm measured radially), and
separated by interstriae. Alveolae are complex and simple. Marginal fultoportulae have three satellite pores
and are located on all recessed costae within alveolar chambers internally. They open by short tubes on the
external valve surface. One or two rimoportulae are present also on recessed costae between two alveolar
openings. A closed valvocopula and several open copulae without puncta are present.
Morphotype 2 (Figs 71, 74, 76, 77)
Description:—Frustules solitary, elliptical-lanceolate in valve view, with several girdle bands. A closed
valvocopula has numerous plaques along the valve. Several open bands, as a valvocopula, lack areolae.
Dimensions of major axis of valves vary from 11.7 to 42.7 µm, of minor axis from 7 to 30 µm. Valve face is
distinctly divided into two zones: a marginal alveolate zone and a transversely undulate, elongated areolate
central area. A narrow, irregular hyaline area separates these two zones. Central area is elliptical,
symmetrically undulate: elevated and depressed parts are almost equal. Areolae with internal domed cribra
and external foramina are arranged mainly irregularly. One valve face fultoportula with two satellite pores
internally and a round thickened aperture externally can be seen within the central area, rarely can be absent.
Striae, 10–12 in 10 µm, are slightly radiate in the middle part of the marginal zone and strongly radiate
towards the valve ends. Striae consisting of two-four rows of small puncta (40–50 puncta in 10 µm) are
divided by interstriae (costae). Alveolae are complex and simple, 10–12 in 10 µm. Marginal fultoportulae
have three satellite pores internally and open by short tubes externally. They are positioned on all recessed
costae within alveolar chambers on the internal valve surface. One or two rimoprtulae are sessile internally,
and each is located on a costa between two alveolar openings in the pole area. Rimoportulae open by a round
apertures externally. Spines can be present on the valve face/mantle junction, but they are often broken.

Discussion
Variation in Cyclotella morphology has been documented with light and electron microscopy over the past 35
years (e.g. Lowe, 1975; Serieyssol, 1981, 1993; Servant-Vildary 1986; Håkansson 2002; Tanaka 2007), and
from this diversity a number of formal and informal groups have been identified and named. Most recently
Houk et al. (2010) identified three morphological groups within Cyclotella:
Group 1: possess tangentially undulate to nearly flat valves, with the central part lacking areolae, and a single
rimoportula within the ring of marginal fultoportulae (and contains the nomenclatural type of the genus C.
distinguenda Hustedt (1927: 320))
Group 2: possess the valve face tangentially undulate or nearly flat, central area is without areolae and at least
one rimoportula not within the ring of marginal fultoportulae (included here, for example, are the well known
species C. comensis Grunow in Van Heurck (1882: pl. 93, figs 16, 17), C. ocellata Pantocsek (1902: 104) and
others)
Group 3: possess the valve face tangentially undulate or nearly flat , a central area with areolae, one
rimoportula not within the ring of marginal fultoportulae, but on the valve face, nearer to the center complex
alveolae (C. bodanica Eulenstein in Grunow (1878: 126), C. comta (Ehrenberg) Kützing (1849: 20), etc.)
Observations on centric diatoms from western North America presented here suggest the presence of three
additional morphological groups:
A. one group with C. idahica, C. jonesii and C. stoermeri; this group is closely related to C. oregonica
Kociolek & Khursevich, though this last species lacks areolae in the center of the valve (Khursevich &
Kociolek 2008);
B. the second group has C. discostellaeformica;
C. the third group is comprises C. pseudokansasica and C. kansasica. Also included here is C. mahoodii
Kociolek & Khursevich in Khursevich & Kociolek (2008: 41), which also lacks central areolae
(Khursevich & Kociolek 2008).
Presence of a variety of taxa with, and without, central areolae in other groups that are otherwise diagnosed by
a variety of features, suggest the feature of presence/absence of areolae in the central area is homoplasious,
and not helpful in diagnosing natural groups. Data on the morphology of C. elgeri supported the transfer of
this taxon, first suggested by Khursevich & Kociolek (2002), to the genus Tertiarius (Houk et al. 2010).
The species of Cyclotella considered here can be separated into three morphological groups with respect
mainly to the structure of alveolae and position(s) of rimoportula(e) and marginal fultoportulae. One of these
groups is composed of 3 extinct species and distinguished by a variety of valve outlines, including circular to
round (C. idahica, and C. stoermeri) to elliptical-lanceolate or even rhomboid-ellipsoid (C. jonesii). The
central area is from almost flat or slightly concentrically undulate to strongly transversely undulate. The latter
is characteristic of C. idahica and C. jonesii. The central area may consist of areolae only (C. stoermeri and
C. jonesii), or of both areolae and valve face fultoportulae, internally surrounded by two or three or rarely four
satellite pores (C. idahica). The position of rimoportulae in species from this group is one of recessed costae
within marginal chambers that can be observed on the internal valve surface. Alveolae are complex and
simple. Marginal fultoportulae with three satellite pores internally are located also on recessed costae within
alveolar chambers. Spines may be present in this group.
Cyclotella idahica is very similar morpholgically to C. jonesii, differing mainly in valve outline, having
smaller dimensions, presence of valve face fultoportulae and pronounced bumps on the face of the valve.
Cyclotella idahica and C. jonesii may well be sister taxa and discreet character differences suggests they be
recognized as separate taxa.

Cyclotella jonesii resembles C. oregonica Kociolek & Khursevich in Khursevich & Kociolek (2008: 44)
in the outline of the valve and presence of other valve features described above for C. jonesii, but differs from
C. oregonica in that the latter lacks valve face areolae.
Cyclotella stoermeri is similar to C. iris Brun & Heribaud (1893: 224) in the structure of the marginal
striated zone, presence of simple and complex alveolae, position of the rimportula and marginal fultoportulae
on the internal recessed costae and absence of valve face fultoportulae (Serieyssol 1984). These taxa differ in
the lack of areolae in the central area and mainly flat or slightly convex valves in C. iris.
The second morphological group is represented by Cyclotella discostelliformica which resembles species
of the genus Discostella (Houk & Klee 2004) in having well expressed concave-convex central area, slit-like
external expression of the rimoportula and location of the rimoportula and marginal fultoportulae sometimes
in the marginal part of the alveolae.
The third morphological group includes the extinct species C. kansasica and C. pseudokansasica, which
is characterized by circular valves with a flat central areolar area. Valve face fultoportulae are absent within
the central area. Alveolae are simple. A single rimoportula is positioned on one of the costae, marginal
fultoportulae are located on costae separating alveolar openings on the internal valve surface.
Cyclotella kansasica is similar to C nevadica Khursevich & Kociolek (2008: 42) in the structure of
alveolae, rimoportulae with radially-oriented internal slit and marginal fultoportulae located on costae, and
absence of valve face fultoportulae. The two species differ in the relief of the valves, length of striated
marginal zone, and lack of valve face areolae in C. nevadica.
With regard to Puncticulata, Houk et al. (2010, p. 4–5) write, “As for the genus Puncticulata Håkansson
(Hakansson 2002), it was based on Cyclotella comta Kutzing 1849 (nom.cons.). However, there is
Puncticulata austriaca (Peragallo) Håkansson also mentioned as a synonym of Handmannia austriaca
Peragallo in Handmann (1913: 14). But this is the type of validly published genus Handmannia Peragallo in
Handmann (1913: 14) and from this point of view the generic name Puncticulata Hakansson is illegitimate by
the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Art. 52. So we preferred to retain the previous generic
name Cyclotella for the Puncticulata taxa.”
Our observations on these mainly Pliocene aged species suggest that there are close morphological
similarities between them and Puncticulata, as diagnosed by Håkansson (2002). Some of the relationships
seem very close, with the only difference differentiating between members of the three morphological groups
we describe here and members of Puncticulata is the lack of valve face areolae in the Cyclotella taxa. If the
primary feature used by Håkansson to distinguish Puncticulata, namely presence of valve face areolae
(Håkansson 2002), would turn out to be primitive among this group of very closely related taxa, it might result
in Puncticulata not representing a natural group (Houk et al. 2010).
Detailed phylogenetic analysis of this group of taxa, along with Tertiarius and Pliocaenicus, is required to
sort out the complex set of features displayed among them. Interesting will be the fact that only a small subset
of them have extant taxa, thus such an analysis will require and indicate the important role of fossil in
understanding the relationships among this important group of freshwater diatoms.
