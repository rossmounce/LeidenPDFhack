Abstract
In this contribution the rediscovery of the lianas Arrabidaea chica (Bignoniaceae) and Entada polystachya var.
polyphylla (Fabaceae-Mimosoideae) in Puerto Rico is reported. These species were first collected during the 1880s and
subsequently considered extirpated. Their current status in Puerto Rico is discussed, and recommendations for their
conservation are offered.

Introduction
During the decade of 1880, the German botanist Paul Ernst Emil Sintenis and the Puerto Rican naturalist
Agustín Stahl collected several plant species and made significant contributions to the knowledge of the flora
of Puerto Rico (Urban 1903–1911, Stahl 1883–1888). During their explorations throughout the island,
Sintenis and Stahl collected several species new to science and new records for Puerto Rico, some of which
are still known only from their collections (Acevedo-Rodríguez 2007, 2013). Examples of these are
Arrabidaea chica (Bonpl. in Humboldt & Bonpland 1807: 107, pl. 31) Verlot (1868: 154) (Bignoniaceae) and
Entada polystachya (Linnaeus 1753: 520) Candolle (1825: 425) var. polyphylla (Bentham 1840: 133)
Barneby (1996: 175) [synonym: Entadopsis polyphylla (Benth.) Britton (in Britton & Rose 1928: 191)]
(Fabaceae-Mimosoideae), both collected in 1885 and 1886. Arrabidaea chica was collected by both botanists
in Bayamón, while E. polystachya var. polyphylla was collected in Fajardo by Sintenis and between Manatí
and Vega Baja by Stahl. Until recently, the two taxa have never been recollected in Puerto Rico and were
considered as extirpated (Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005). During recent botanical explorations in Puerto Rico, I
have recollected both species, which are reported here.
Arrabidaea chica
Arrabidaea chica is a liana that can reach about 15 m in length with fragrant violet flowers produced in
terminal panicles, and linear or narrowly-elliptical dehiscent capsules that produce many winged seeds
(Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005). This species is widely distributed in the continental Neotropics and is only
documented in the Antilles from St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands (Acevedo-Rodríguez 1996) and Puerto Rico
(Liogier & Martorell 2000, Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005). In Puerto Rico, A. chica is known from three
collections made by Sintenis and Stahl at unspecified localities in the municipality of Bayamón in northern
Puerto Rico (Urban 1903–1911, Fig. 1). Sintenis made a single collection of a fruiting individual of A. chica
on 20 March 1885 on a limestone hill (Sintenis 1096, BM!, G!, GH!, K!, L!, W!), while the other two
specimens were collected by Stahl from forests and thickets (Stahl 79 & 541). He considered these collections
a new species and described them as Adenocalymna portoricensis Stahl (1888: 186), which was latter placed

in synonymy with A. chica (Urban 1903–1911, Acevedo- Rodríguez 2007). One of Stahl’s specimens was
flowering on July 1886 (Stahl 541, L!), while the other (Stahl 79) has not yet been located. The specimens at B
are no longer extant (Dr. Robert Vogt, pers. comm.). I have searched extant duplicates in over 25 herbaria in
11 countries, but the search has been unsuccessful. Apart from these three early collections, A. chica has not
been recorded from Puerto Rico and it was thought that it was most likely extirpated (Liogier & Martorell
2000, Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005).
In February 2007, during a botanical exploration of the “Monte de Santa Ana” limestone hills in Bayamón
(18°24' N 66°08' W; 90 m a.s.l.; Fig. 1), a single individual of A. chica was found near the top of a limestone
hill (Caraballo 1456 and 1480, UPR!). This individual was about 10 m long, sterile, shedding leaves, and
growing on an exposed cliff scrambling over rocks and trees. The same plant was found fruiting in May 2009
(Caraballo 2855, UPR!). Further explorations to locate more individuals of the species on this and other
limestone hills of the area have been fruitless. The vegetation at the site where A. chica was found is
secondary and dominated by lianas, vines, and herbs. The surrounding vegetation is dominated by a
developed limestone forest dominated by native trees such as Bursera simaruba (L.) Sarg. (Burseraceae),
Guarea guidonia (L.) Sleumer (Meliaceae), and Sideroxylon portoricense Urb. (Sapotaceae).
Besides Arrabidaea chica, the “Monte de Santa Ana” limestone hills are home to over thirty endangered,
rare or remarkable species of the karstic region of northern Puerto Rico (Table 1). Some of these are very rare
and only known from one or a few individuals in the limestone hills of northeastern Puerto Rico. These
include the trees Manilkara pleeana (Pierre) Cronq. (Sapotaceae), Oxandra laurifolia (Sw.) A.Rich.
(Annonaceae) and Coccothrinax barbadensis (Lodd. ex Mart.) Becc. (Arecaceae), the endemic shrub
Malpighia fucata Ker Gawl. (Malpighiaceae) and the vines Jacquemontia verticillata (L.) Urb.
(Convolvulaceae) and Canavalia nitida (Cav.) Piper (Fabaceae-Faboideae). In contrast, some rare and
endangered species maintain numerous populations in this area, such as the trees Erythrina eggersii Krukoff
& Moldenke (Fabaceae-Faboideae) and Ottoschulzia rhodoxylon (Urb.) Urb. (Icacinaceae). Interestingly, a
nearby limestone hill holds a large population of the endangered plant Buxus vahlii Baill. (Buxaceae),
suggesting that not all limestone hills in this area share the same composition of rare species. These hills have
served as a shelter for the native flora because their rugged topography made them unsuitable for agricultural
purposes and as such they were not completely deforested during the intense agricultural period of the 18th and
19th centuries. The conservation of these limestone hills is crucial for the survival of many native species of
plants and animals, particularly in highly populated and fragmented landscapes such as the metropolitan area
of San Juan. At present, the limestone hill where A. chica was found is legally protected by the National Park
Company of the Government of Puerto Rico as part of the Julio Enrique Monagas National Park. In addition,
A. chica is listed as a critical element of the flora of Puerto Rico by the Department of Natural and
Environmental Resources of The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (DNER 2008). Besides the legal protection,
the successful conservation of A. chica in Puerto Rico is dependent on the specific preservation and
propagation of the known individual. The main current threats to its survival are wild fires and vegetation
clearance, particularly on the cliffs where rock climbing is practiced. Although vegetative propagation
(through branch cuttings using a rooting hormone) has been successful, propagation by seeds has failed. The
conservation of A. chica also has medical relevance, as the species has anti-inflammatory and wound-healing
properties, among other benefits (e.g., Jorge et al. 2008).
Entada polystachya var. polyphylla
Entada polystachya var. polyphylla is a liana that can grow to 10 m long with flowers arranged in a terminal
raceme of cylindrical spikes bearing white stamens, and produces flat pods that separate into one-seeded
segments (Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005). This taxon is present in South America (Amazonian Brazil, Ecuador,
Peru, southwest Venezuela and the Guianas) and Puerto Rico (Barneby 1996). In Puerto Rico, E. polystachya
var. polyphylla is known from two collections made by Sintenis and Stahl (Urban 1903–1911). Sintenis
collected a flowering individual on 5 February 1885 at the base of a hill named “Monte de Mula” next to a river in

the municipality of Fajardo in northeastern Puerto Rico (Sintenis 1240, B!, BM!, GH!, L!, LD!, S!, US!, W!) (Fig.
1). On October of the next year, Stahl collected a flowering individual in a sandy area between the municipalities
of Manatí and Vega Baja in northern Puerto Rico (Stahl 590, B!; Fig. 1). As no more specimens of E. polystachya
var. polyphylla were collected again, it was considered extremely rare or extirpated (Acevedo-Rodríguez 2005,
Axelrod 2011).
In July 2009, a solitary individual of E. polystachya var. polyphylla was found near Road PR-191 in the
municipality of Naguabo in the eastern region of Puerto Rico (Caraballo 2921, UPR!) (18°15' N 65°47' W;
345 m a.s.l.; Fig. 1). This locality is about 16 km southwest from the town of Fajardo, and although the exact
position of the historical collection made by Sintenis is uncertain, both the historical and the current locality
are in eastern Puerto Rico (Fig. 1). The individual of E. polystachya var. polyphylla was about 9 m long,
flowering, and growing over other trees in a sunny area with large rocks. The surrounding vegetation was
disturbed and included grasses, invasive vines, and some persisting cultivated plants. Other uncommon native
vines found at the site were Dioclea reflexa Hook. f. (Fabaceae-Faboideae) and Mucuna urens (L.) DC.
(Fabaceae-Faboideae).
Like A. chica, E. polystachya var. polyphylla is listed as a critical element of the flora of Puerto Rico by
the Department of Natural and Environmental Resources of The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (DNER
2008). Nevertheless, the only known individual of the species in Puerto Rico is on a private property and
threatened by deforestation and wild fires. In addition, it should be noted that, although the flowers observed
seems healthy, after flowering the inflorescence spikes became swollen and no fruits were observed
(Caraballo 2921, UPR!). Further research is necessary to determine the cause of this deformity and the
fertility of the individual. The successful conservation of E. polystachya var. polyphylla in Puerto Rico
depends on the protection and propagation of the mentioned plant.

FIGURE 1. Map of the island of Puerto Rico showing the localities where the lianas Arrabidaea chica (circle) and Entada
polystachya var. polyphylla (triangle) were rediscovered. The historical localities where E. polystachya var. polyphylla was collected
during the 19th Century includes the municipality of Fajardo (rhombus) and the area between the municipalities of Manatí and Vega
Baja (square). All the historical records of A. chica are from unspecified localities within the municipality of Bayamón.

Conclusions
There are numerous taxa in the Caribbean known only from few collections made during the 19th and early 20th
centuries. Fortunately, some of them have been recently rediscovered during botanical explorations (Judd et al.
2011). Such is the case with the vine Anechites nerium (Aubl.) Urb. (Apocynaceae), which was reported to
Puerto Rico by Stahl in 1888 in the municipality of Vega Baja (Stahl 870, US!) and rediscovered in the
municipalities of Arecibo and Quebradillas in 2001 and 2004 respectively (all localities in northern Puerto Rico).
Even though the flora of Puerto Rico is one of the best documented in the Caribbean region (Torres-Santana et
al. 2010), new species and populations of rare and endangered plants are still being found (Axelrod 2011).

The Caribbean islands comprise 2.3% of the world’s flora, and are considered as a Biodiversity Hotspot
(Myers et al. 2000). The combination of high biodiversity with high deforestation rates, climate change, and
invasive species emphasizes the need for conservation. This should go hand in hand with further botanical
exploration of the Antilles, because species long thought to be extirpated or extinct may still be around in very
small numbers, and may be in need of local protection and conservation.
