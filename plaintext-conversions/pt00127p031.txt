Abstract
A new species of tube-dwelling diatom, unusual in being araphid, is described from benthic coral reef habitats in Guam,
Palau, Puerto Rico and Jamaica. Gato gen. nov. is heteropolar and heterovalvar, exhibits very fine striae delimiting a
narrow and irregular sternum, and possesses a series of rimmed pores on each side of the foot pole. One valve of the
frustule has a rimoportula at the foot pole, but both valves possess a rimoportula at the head pole. The generitype, G.
hyalinus sp. nov. forms small, branched colonies. Individual cells are oval, slightly tapered along the apical axis, 30–40
µm x 13–15 µm, with 60–70 striae in 10 µm. On the foot pole with a rimoportula the rimmed pores are connected to the
sternum by diagonal striae; several additional rimmed pores interrupt transapical striae further up both valves. We
compare valve structure of G. hyalinus with Florella portoricensis and F. pascuensis, which we report for the first time
from the Marshall Islands, and to Licmophora spp. We find no taxa to which this genus is related, and can identify no
structure potentially homologous to the series of rimmed pores among the diatoms.
Key words: araphid diatom, Bacillariophyceae, coral reefs, tube-dwelling diatom, rimmed pores, rimoportulae

Introduction
Tube-dwelling diatoms (i.e., those that live in mucilage tubes usually of their own making) occur in many
marine benthic habitats, from underneath polar ice (Medlin 1990) to tropical reefs (Lobban & Mann 1987,
Navarro 1987). In many temperate regions they form macroscopic colonies that resemble brown seaweeds
and can reach bloom populations (Cox 1975, 1981, Lobban 1983, 1989), but most tropical colonies are
microscopic. Only Nitzschia martiana (C. Agardh 1827: 629) Van Heurck (1896: 406) is exceptionally seen
with the naked eye (Lobban & Mann 1987, Lobban & Tsuda 2003), but is more commonly discovered with a
microscope. The taxonomic diversity in marine tube-dwelling diatoms includes several species of Berkeleya
Greville (1827: pl. 294) and Parlibellus Cox (1988: 19) (Naviculales: Berkeleyaceae) (Cox 1975, 1988,
Mizuno 1979, Navarro 1987), several species of Navicula Sect. Lineatae (Naviculales: Naviculacae), several
species of Nitzschia Hassall (1845: 435) (Bacillariales: Bacillariaceae) (Lobban 1984, 1985), and at least two
species of Gyrosigma Hassall (1845: 435) (Naviculalaes: Pleurosigmataceae) (Smith 1856, Sterrenburg 1989,
Jansson et al. 1994). In addition, Mastogloia cocconeiformis Grunow (1860: 578) (Mastogloiales:
Mastogloiaceae) forms branched tubes with a single cell at the base of each branch (John 1993, Hein et al.
1993). Besides these tube formers, several Navicula and Nitzschia species cohabit tubes made by other
species (Lobban 1984, Basson & Sims 1998). All taxa mentioned above are biraphid, and many are motile
within the tubes. However, we encountered an araphid species that forms very small, branched colonies and
has an apparently hyaline valve face in LM. We describe this species in a new genus and compare it to some
other araphid taxa from Guam, especially Licmophora C. Agardh (1827: 628) and two species of Florella J.N.
Navarro (1982: 248).

Methods
Diatom samples were collected by hand during scuba diving or snorkeling in Guam, Palau and the Marshall
Islands (CSL), Puerto Rico and Jamaica (JNN). Live and acid-cleaned samples were observed in LM and
SEM as described in our previous work on Puerto Rico and Guam (Navarro 1996; Lobban et al. 2010).
Referenced specimens except the types are in the authors’ collections.
Terminology: In this genus there are both labiate openings, i.e. rimoportulae, and non-labiate openings. To
distinguish the latter, and to avoid the assumption that they are homologous to rimoportulae, we adopt the
descriptive term “rimmed pore” (porus marginatus), which Round et al. (1990) used with reference to a small
opening in the middle of some valves of Podocystis J.W. Bailey (1854: 11).

Observations:—Colonies (Figs 1–4) are a few cells long, sometimes branched, each cell at the end of a
section of tube, from which the next section arose off-center; Fig. 4 suggests at least a temporary septum
within the tubes. In Fig. 1 there appear to be cohabitant naviculoids in the tubes; these have not been
commonly observed. Gato hyalinus cells are broadly oval, slightly narrower at the basal end, apparently with
many elongate-lenticular plastids (Figs 1–4), and the cells arranged in the colonies with the narrower pole
toward the base. Frustules are also slightly tapered in girdle view (Fig. 4). In acid-cleaned valves in LM (Figs
5, 6), the rimoportulae can be seen, and sometimes a faint sternum, but the striae are too fine to resolve and the
valves appear hyaline.

In SEM, the valve surface is smooth, with rounded margins, striae 60–70 in 10 µm consisting of uniseriate
rows of simple circular pores (Fig. 19) that extend to the valve border (Figs 7, 8, 10, 11, 20). In places, the
pattern could be described as quincunx (e.g., Fig. 13) but the spacing between pores in the striae is generally
insufficiently consistent. There is a narrow, irregular break in the striae along the centerline, barely
constituting a sternum (Figs 7–16, 20). Striae are parallel except at the head pole, where they radiate from the
end of the sternum (Figs 16, 20), and in association with the rimmed pores (Figs 8, 10). Both valves have a
small rimoportula at the head pole near the valve apex, at or beyond the end of the sternum (Figs 9, 12, 13, 16,
20), but the two valves are different at the foot pole. There, only one valve of the frustule has a rimoportula
and more strongly oblique striae —the “cat’s whiskers” for which the genus is named (Figs 8, 10), the other
valve lacks a rimoportula at the foot pole (Figs 12–20). Both foot poles have several large rimmed pores, i.e.,

that have slightly thickened rims internally (Figs 7, 8, 10, 11, 15, 17). There are two series of rimmed pores,
typically 4–5 on each side of the foot pole on the valve with a rimoportula; there are only 3 on those without a
foot-pole rimoportula. In addition several irregularly placed pores occurred near the foot pole on both valves,
interrupting 2 or more striae (Fig. 15, 18), but are not observed near the head pole. On valves with a basal
rimoportula there are pairs of oblique striae extending from the sternum to the basal set of rimmed (Figs 7, 8,
10, 11); these are not obvious on valves without a basal rimoportula, where only some irregularity in the striae
was observed (Figs 14, 15, 17). We have little information on girdle bands, but they appear to be finely
punctate (Fig. 21), similar to the valve surface.
Genera morphologically most similar to Gato are Florella and Licmophora. We do not suggest that either
of these is related to Gato. Besides Navarro’s (1982, 1996, 2002) descriptions, we have observed Florella
portoricensis Navarro (1982: 248, 258, emend Navarro 1996: 304) (Fig. 22) and Florella pascuensis Navarro
(2002: 284) (Fig. 23) from the Republic of the Marshall Islands; this is the first confirmed report of these
species from that country, and the first confirmed record of F. portoricensis from the Pacific Ocean. In
addition Lobban et al. (2012) observed and cultured samples of F. pascuensis from Guam. The valves of
Florella spp. are isopolar with parallel striae of cribrate areolae continuing unbroken to the valve border from
an indistinct sternum; there are no pore fields. F. portoricensis has a series of rudimentary rimoportulae at
each apex, indistinguishable from areolae except in internal SEM views, whereas F. pascuensis has two
labiate rimoportulae, one at each end of the sternum, visible even in LM (Navarro 1996, 2002). F. pascuensis
also has a unique pattern of slit-like areolae at each end.
Frustules of Licmophora spp., on the other hand, are heteropolar and heterovalvar. A series of (5 to >30)
simple slits at the foot pole is developed into a distinctive multiscissura (Figs 24, 25). The areolae (Fig. 24) are
separated by virgae and viminae (Honeywill 1988). Although the rimoportulae of most Licmophora species
are labiate rimoportulae (Fig. 25), in L. flabellata (Carmichael mscr. 1826, according to Agardh) C. Agardh
(1831: 41, emend Sar & Ferrario 1990: 404) the head pole rimoportula and the unique series of extra
rimoportulae along the sternum lack labia (Fig. 26). These have been characterized by Sar & Ferrario (1990)
as “sessile rimoportulae” and are perhaps similar in structure (though not position) to the rimmed pores in
Gato.

Discussion
Based on morphological criteria Gato does not appear close to any known genus of araphid diatoms.
Licmophora species are an intriguing comparison because, like Gato, all are heteropolar, with distinctive
structure at the basal pole; many are also heterovalvar with a basal rimoportula on only one valve. Some
species of Licmophora have a rimoportula at the head pole on both valves, others have only one on the valve
that lacks a foot-pole rimoportula. However, while the multiscissura might have a similar function to the
series of basal rimmed pores in Gato, there is no evidence of homology, and there is no reason to suppose a
relationship between Gato and Licmophora. The general structure of Florella is similar to Gato and unlike
other araphids, but the symmetrical valves and the colony type are not like Gato. The most characteristic
feature of Gato is the series of rimmed pores, for which we can find no parallel. Most araphids have a single
rimoportula at one or both poles, but Sar & Ferrario (1990) have shown that L. flabellata is an exception. The
Florellaceae Navarro (1996: 301) was established on the basis of a single species (now it has two species), and
its limits may need emending, but for the time being we leave Gato without familial or ordinal assignment.
The tube-dwelling habit of Gato is so far unique among araphids, but there is no reason to suppose a
correlation between valve structure (e.g., the rimmed pores) and tube formation. While mucilage is often
associated with apical pore fields (e.g., Grammatophora Ehrenberg (1840: 46), see Sato et al. 2008) or
distinctive pores (e.g., partectal pores in some Mastogloia Thwaites in W. Smith (1856: 63), see Stephens &
Gibson 1979; Hein et al. 1993), no special structure is present in raphid tube-forming diatoms (Cox 1981;
Lobban 1989). Similarly, while stalk secretion in Licmophora might be associated with the multiscissura, no

evident structural features at the attachment pole are present in other taxa attached to stalks [e.g., Mastogloia
inaqeualis Cleve (1895: 250) and M. cuneata (Meister 1937: 268) Simonsen (1990: 134)– Lobban et al.
(2012), Climacosphenia Ehrenberg (1843: 401) spp., Ardissonea De Notaris in De Notaris & Baglietto (1870:
no. 334) spp.] or attached by a mucilage pad at one pole [e.g., Podocystis spp., Toxarium undulatum Bailey
(1854: 15)]. Although diatom movement is most often associated with the raphe system, araphid diatoms can
also move. For example Toxarium J.W. Bailey (1854: 15) cells moved with one pole in contact with the
substratum (Kooistra et al. 2003) but has no special structures to allow movement.
Gato hyalinus is easily overlooked as a girdle band in acid cleaned samples in LM but on the basis of our
records of in the western Pacific and the Caribbean, we expect that it is widespread in the tropics.
