Abstract
We investigated the phylogenetic placement of Cyanaeorchis and selected representatives of the tribe Cymbidieae based
on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK–trnK and rbcL) DNA sequences. Bayesian and parsimony analyses of separate and
combined datasets were largely congruent with each other and showed that the Neotropical Cyanaeorchis does not
belongs in the predominantly Old World subtribe Eulophiinae, where it has previously been placed. Instead, it is strongly
supported as a sister to Grobya in Catasetinae. Because Catasetinae are Neotropical and there are no unequivocal
morphological similarities between Cyanaeorchis and other genera in the subtribe, this relationship reflects a
geographical rather than morphological similarity and suggest habitat-driven local diversification. Specimens from
central Brazil formerly identified as Cyanaeorchis minor are shown to be a distinct species, described here as C.
praetermissa. Niche modeling indicates that C. praetermissa and C. minor have different distributions and ecological
niches, whereas a third species, C. arundinae has broader climatic tolerances and a distribution that encompasses those
of the other two species. The distribution of the genus is also predicted to include Bolivia, the states of Rio de Janeiro,
Espirito Santo and several areas in northeastern Brazil, from where no collections are currently known.

Introduction
Cyanaeorchis Barbosa Rodrigues (1877: 112) is a small genus of two species distributed from the Espinhaço range
in the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil to central, southeastern and southern Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay.
Species of Cyanaeorchis are terrestrial and found in humid grasslands, permanent swamps and marshes, usually
from 600 to 1700 m, but also near sea level at latitudes greater than 27o S. Flowering is mainly from October to
January, from the beginning to the peak of the rainy season. Plants of Cyanaeorchis have distinct growth and
dormancy phases - a new vegetative shoot, leaves and terminal flowers are produced in the rainy season during the
spring and summer. During the dry season or winter, the aerial parts wither and the plant survives as a short
underground stem with roots, which makes possible a new cycle of growth in the following rainy season.
The first species of Cyanaeorchis was originally described as Eulophia arundinae Reichenbach (1850: 854).
Barbosa Rodrigues recognized a series of differences with Eulophia and proposed the genus Cyanaeorchis. The
main distinctive characters were the terminal inflorescence, four pollinia and the lack of a spur on the labellum in
Cyanaeorchis. Cogniaux (1898–1902) and Hoehne (1942) accepted and summarized knowledge of the genus.

Phylogenetic placement of Cyanaeorchis has been unclear. Since Reichenbach (1850), most authors have
considere it to have some relationship to Eulophia Brown in Lindley (1821a: 573) and the corresponding subtribe,
usually Eulophiinae Bentham (1881: 287) (Dressler 1981, 1993, Chase et al. 2003, Pridgeon et al. 2009).
Szlachetko (1995, 2003) included Cyanaeorchis in Cymbidiinae Bentham (1881: 287), but that version of
Cymbidiinae partially corresponds to what was defined as Eulophiinae by other authors. In contrast to other
authors, Schlechter (1915) placed Cyanaeorchis in Polystachyinae Schlechter (1915: 292), which included Ansellia
Lindley (1844: 12), Polystachya Hooker (1824: 103) and Galeandra Lindley in Lindley & Bauer (1830: 8),
whereas Eulophia was placed in Cyrtopodiinae Bentham (1881: 288) along with Geodorum Jackson (1811: 626),
Eulophiopsis Pfitzer (1877: 105), now considered a synonym of Graphorkis Thouars (1809: 318), Eulophiella
Linden & Rolfe (1892: 29), Cyrtopodium Brown (1813: 216), Govenia Lindley (1832: 153) and Warrea Lindley
(1843a: 14).
Dressler (1993) was the first author to formally include Cyanaeorchis in Eulophiinae, but his morphological
characterization of the subtribe did not match the morphological characters of Cyanaeorchis. Pridgeon et al. (2009)
kept Cyanaeorchis in Eulophiinae and presented an expanded circumscription of the subtribe. However, beyond the
general similarity between the flowers of Cyanaeorchis and some species of Eulophia, there are no clear,
unequivocal morphological characters that link Cyanaeorchis to Eulophia or any other genus of Eulophiinae. For
instance, Eulophiinae generally have pseudobulbs or an underground rhizomatous perennating organ (but not in
Acrolophia Pfitzer 1887: 59), a lateral inflorescence (terminal in Acrolophia), two pollinia and a conspicuous stipe,
whereas Cyanaeorchis has no pseudobulbs, a terminal inflorescence, four pollinia and an inconspicuous stipe.
Another difference is found in distribution. Cyanaeorchis is restricted to the New World, in Brazil, Paraguay and
northern Argentina, whereas Eulophiinae are predominantly Afro-Madagascan with extensions into tropical Asia,
Australasia (Pridgeon et al. 2009) and a few (perhaps only three if Cyanaeorchis is excluded) in the American
tropics. A few species of Eulophia and Oeceoclades (Eulophiinae) also occur in the New World, but these genera
are mainly African, and in most cases, the same species, Eulophia alta (Linnaeus 1767: 594) Fawcett & Rendle
(1910: 112) and Eulophia ruwenzoriensis Rendle (1895: 166), occurs in both continents, suggesting a recent longdistance dispersal from Africa to the New World. Oeceoclades maculata (Lindley 1821b: 15) Lindley (1833: 237)
is a recently introduced invasive. These discrepancies raised doubts about phylogenetic placement of
Cyanaeorchis.
Until recently, material of Cyanaeorchis had not been available for DNA studies, precluding a phylogenetic
analysis of the genus using molecular data. Recent collections of the genus were few, and none had included
samples for DNA extraction. Here, we report a phylogenetic analysis of Cyanaeorchis and selected representatives
of tribe Cymbidieae Pfitzer (1887: 105) based on nuclear (ITS) and plastid (matK–trnK and rbcL) DNA sequences.
Furthermore, specimens from central Brazil previously identified as Cyanaeorchis minor Schlechter (1920: 332)
were found to represent a distinct new species, which is described here.

Material and methods
Taxonomic sampling for phylogenetic analysis
Because the phylogenetic position of Cyanaeorchis in Eulophiinae was uncertain, our ingroup consisted in
selected species of most other subtribes of Cymbidieae. Exemplars of all species of Cyanaeorchis and
representative species of most subtribes of Cymbidieae recognized by Pridgeon et al. (2009), namely Catasetinae
Lindley (1843b: 22), Coeliopsidinae Szlachetko (1995: 97), Cymbidiinae, Cyrtopodinae, Eriopsidinae Szlachetko
(1995: 94), Eulophiinae, Maxillariinae Bentham (1881: 288), Oncidiinae Bentham (1881: 288), Stanhopeinae
Bentham (1881: 288) and Zygopetalinae Schlechter (1915: 417), except Vargasiellinae Schweinfurth in Romero &
Carnevali (1993: 79), were analyzed in this study. Species of Polystachya (Vandeae Lindley (1826: 14),
Polystachyinae) and Phalaenopsis Blume (1825: 294) (Vandeae, Aeridinae Pfitzer 1887: 108) were used as
outgroups. Selection of outgroups was based on the phylogenetic analysis of Cameron et al. (1999), which placed
the clade Epidendrae–Vandae as sister to Cymbidieae. The same outgroups were also used in the phylogenetic
analyses of Cymbidieae of Pridgeon et al. (2009). Except for the Cyanaeorchis sequences obtained for this study,
all sequences used in this analysis were downloaded from GenBank. Accession numbers are provided in Table 1.

Molecular markers
Nucleotide sequences from one nuclear genome region (ITS) and three plastid regions (matK, trnK 3’ intron
and rbcL) were used in analyses. Amplifications of ITS were performed with primers 17SE and 26SE (Sun et al.
1994). The plastid DNA regions included the partial sequence of the matK gene, the complete sequence of the trnK
3’ intron, and the complete sequence of the rbcL gene. The partial sequence of the matK gene and flanking region
of the trnK 3’ intron were amplified with primers 390F (5'-CGATCTATTCATTCAATATTTC-3') and 2R (5'C C C G G A A C TA G T C G G AT G - 3 ' ) . T h e r b c L g e n e w a s a m p l i f i e d w i t h p r i m e r s F 1 ( 5 ' ATGTCACCACAAACAGAAAC-3') and 1379R (5'-TCACAAGCAGCAGCTAGTTCAGGACTC-3'). Marker
selection was based on availability of sequences from other genera of Cymbidieae in public databases and the
general use of these markers for inferring phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic levels in Cymbidieae
and other Orchidaceae (Cameron et al. 1999, Whitten et al. 2000, Salazar et al. 2003, Freudenstein et al. 2004, van
den Berg et al. 2005, Pridgeon et al. 2009). Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh or silica gel-dried material
using the 2× CTAB method adapted from Doyle & Doyle (1987) or the protocol described by de la Cruz et al.
(1997) and optimized for small-scale extraction by Sánchez-Hernández & Gaytán-Oyarzún (2006). Some samples
that did not amplify well were further purified using Qiagen spin columns (DNeasy ® Plant Mini Kit, Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). PCR amplifications were performed in a MJ96G (Biocycler) or Eppendorf Mastercycler
thermal cycler. The general PCR system consisted of 2–3 μl genomic DNA (approximately 20–50 ng of DNA), 1×
PCR buffer (Phoneutria Biotec., Belo Horizonte, Brazil),1.5 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs, 0.2 μM of each primer,
1.5 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Phoneutria Biotec., Belo Horizonte, Brazil) and water in a volume of 30 μl. The
cycling conditions were as follows: an initial denaturation at 94 ºC for 4 min, 35 cycles of 94 ºC for 45 s, 58 ºC for
45 s, 72 ºC for 80 s, and a final extension of 5 min at 72 ºC. PCR products were purified by precipitation with
polyethylene glycol and sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Korea). Sequencing primers were the same as those used for
amplification. Bidirectional sequence reads were obtained for all DNA regions, and the resulting
electropherograms were edited and assembled using the Staden Package software (Bonfield et al. 1995).
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analyses
The edited sequences were aligned with MUSCLE (Edgar 2004), and the resulting alignment was manually
adjusted using MEGA4 software (Tamura et al. 2007) to maximize sequence similarity (Simmons 2004). No data
were excluded from the analyses because of ambiguous alignments. Individual gap positions were treated as
missing data. The data were analyzed with both parsimony and Bayesian inference. Phylogenetic analyses using
maximum parsimony (MP) were performed in PAUP version 4 (Swofford 2002) with Fitch parsimony (Fitch 1971)
as the optimality criterion. Each search consisted of 1,000 replicates of random taxon addition for the starting trees
and branch swapping using the TBR (tree bisection-reconnection) algorithm, only saving up to ten trees per
replicate to avoid extensive swapping on suboptimal islands. All characters were treated as unordered and equally
weighted. Internal support was evaluated by nonparametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein 1985) with 1,000 replicates,
simple addition and TBR branch swapping, saving up to ten trees per replicate. For bootstrap support levels, we
considered bootstrap percentages (BP) of 50–70 as weak, 71–84 as moderate and > 85 as strong (Kress et al. 2002).
Bayesian analysis of individual and combined datasets was implemented in MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Ronquist et al.
2005), treating each DNA region (ITS, matK–trnK and rbcL) as a separate partition. An evolutionary model for
each DNA region was selected with MrModeltest 2 (Nylander 2004). For all data sets, the GTR + I + G model was
selected based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) or hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs). Each
analysis consisted of two independent runs with four chains for 5,000,000 generations, sampling one tree every
1,000 generations. The temperature parameter for heating the chains was 0.2. Convergence between runs was
evaluated by the average standard deviation of split frequencies (<0.01). After discarding the first 25% of the trees
as burn-in, the remaining trees were used to assess topology and posterior probabilities (PP) in a majority-rule
consensus. Because PP in Bayesian analysis are not equivalent to BP and are generally much higher (Erixon et al.
2003), we used criteria similar to a standard statistical test, considering groups with PP > 0.95 as strongly
supported, PP ranging from 0.90–0.95 as moderately supported and PP < 0.90 as weakly supported.
Niche modeling
We assembled a database of 71 taxonomically verified, georeferenced, unique occurrence records of the
species of Cyanaeorchis, including 58 records of C. arundinae, six of C. minor and seven of the new species, C.

generated for each species using Maxent and GARP (Phillips et al. 2004, Stockwell & Noble 1992) and a range of
climatic and topographic variables, which have been shown to be useful for continental and regional scales
(Thuiller et al. 2004). The following climatic variables were used: mean diurnal range, precipitation of driest
quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of coldest quarter and precipitation seasonality (WorldClim;
Hijmans et al. 2005). The topographic variables were as follows: elevation (from WorldClim; Hijmans et al. 2005),
slope inclination and slope orientation (these two were obtained by processing the elevation variable of WorldClim
using ArcGIS 9.3). Variables were selected by evaluating the correlation among variables by means of Pearson’s
correlation coefficient, as in Elith et al. (2006) and Murphy & Lovett (2007). We tested the correlation among all
pairs of variables, and only those with r ≤ 0.7 were used.
Results of the modeling method can be affected by amount of available data; for instance, Papes & Gaubert
(2007) showed that when modeling with small amounts of data, Maxent tended to over-predict the distribution
more than GARP. Because the number of records of C. arundinae and C. minor were comparatively fewer (six and
seven, respectively) than those of C. arundinae (58), we analyzed the data using both Maxent and GARP. Only in
the case of C. arundinae was it possible to evaluate models using test points, i.e., other points distinct from those
used to generate the model, that were posteriorly used to evaluate the model.
Model robustness was evaluated with the area under the curve (AUC) statistic, which is a descriptive index of
the graph of the receiver operating characteristic. Furthermore, results from both algorithms were critically
evaluated on the basis of everything that is known of the natural history of the three species.
Taxonomic analysis
Morphological analyses and descriptions were based on live, pickled or herbarium material. Details of flowers
were examined from the pickled material under a stereoscopic microscope. Data on flowering times, habitats, and
distribution were based on herbarium labels or field observations. Materials and images were examined from the
following herbaria: AMES, BHCB, CEN, F, G, HB, HBG, HUEFS, HUFU, ICN, IPA, K, M, MBM, NY, P, R, RB,
S, SI, SP, SPF, UB, US and W. The descriptive terminology used here is based on Stearn (1992) and Simpson
(2006).

Results
Phylogenetic analyses
Initially, we performed separate analyses for each of the ITS and plastid data sets. Because no significant
incongruence was detected between the plastid and nuclear data (i.e., no conflicting groups obtaining strong
internal support), an analysis was performed with the combined matrix. Because the parsimony trees are largely
congruent with the Bayesian trees but are less resolved and have weaker overall support, the Bayesian trees were
chosen for presentation. General features of the datasets and parsimony statistics for each dataset and analysis are
presented in Table 2.

Overall, the Bayesian tree and the parsimony strict consensus tree of the ITS dataset were congruent. Most
subtribes were found to be monophyletic, except Cymbidiinae and Eulophiinae, because Ansellia and Geodorum,
respectively, were not included in these subtribes, and Maxillariinae, which formed two major clades [(Mormolyca,
Cryptocentrum, Maxillaria, Xylobium, Lycaste) and (Bifrenaria, Rudolfiella, Scuticaria)] that were paraphyletic to
Coeliopsidinae and Stanhopeinae (Fig. 1). Cyanaeorchis, comprising the three species of the genus recognized

here, formed a strongly supported clade (1.00 PP; 100 BP) that was strongly supported (1.00 PP; 99 BP) as sister to
Grobya Lindley (1835: 1740). The Cyanaeorchis–Grobya clade was strongly supported as a member of
Catasetinae (1.00 PP; 100 BP), where it formed a polytomy with a Catasetum–Clowesia–Dressleria–Cycnoches
and a Galeandra clade.
In analyses of the plastid dataset, similarly to that of ITS, most subtribes were recovered as monophyletic, with
the exception of Cymbidiinae, because Ansellia, Graphorkis, and Dipodium Brown (1810: 330), were not included
in this subtribe (Fig. 2). Dipodium was strongly to moderately supported (1.00 PP; 71 BP) as a sister of
Cymbidieae, excluding Cymbidiinae, whereas Ansellia and Graphrochis formed a clade (1.00 PP; 81 BP) that was
sister to Eulophiinae (0.97 PP). The three species of Cyanaeorchis formed a strongly supported clade (1.00 PP; 97
BP) that was a sister to Grobya (1.00 PP; 95 BP) and placed as a sister to other genera in a strongly supported
Catasetinae (1.00 PP; 98 BP).
In the combined analysis, we used two approaches because the species with sequences available in public
databases were not always the same in all datasets. First, we selected most of the sequences used in each of the
individual analysis and treated the species absent in one of the datasets as missing data. Second we selected
sequences in monophyletic genera common to the three datasets (ITS, matK–trnK, rbcL) and treated the taxa at the
generic level, except for the Cyanaeorchis sequences, for which vouchers were the same for all datasets. In both
cases, results were essentially the same, and there were no conflicting groups between the analyses with strong
support. However, in the first case, when plastid and nuclear markers were from different species, resolution was
lower and some genera were recovered as paraphyletic. Therefore, we choose for presentation the Bayesian tree
from the second analysis, which was overall better resolved. With the exception of Cymbidiinae all other subtribes
were recovered with moderate to high support (Fig. 3). Cymbidiinae, excluding Ansellia, were strongly supported
(1.00 PP; 100 BP) as a sister to the remaining subtribes of Cymbidieae, whereas Ansellia was strongly to weakly
supported as sister to Eulophiinae (0.96 PP; 64 BP). Similar to the other analyses, the Cyanaeorchis species formed
a strongly supported clade (1.00 PP; 100 BP) that was a sister to Grobya (1.00 PP; 100 BP), the pair included in
Catasetinae (1.00 PP; 100 BP).
Niche modeling
For Cyanaeorchis arundinae, there was no significant difference in the AUC statistic between the model
generated with GARP (AUC = 0.901) and Maxent (AUC = 0.955), but the former grossly over-predicted the
distribution, i.e., predicted a distribution area much larger than currently known, including several extensive
suitable areas in the Amazon basin. The potential distribution of C. arundinae as modeled with Maxent is shown in
Fig. 4C. The best model was mainly influenced by five variables (elevation, isothermality, precipitation of driest
quarter, precipitation of wettest quarter and slope inclination), which explained over 90% of the model. In the cases
of C. minor and C. praetermissa, Maxent resulted in large over-predictions, similarly to results obtained with
GARP for C. arundinae, but the potential distributions inferred by GARP were much closer to what is known of
the actual distribution of these species. The GARP models for both these species are shown in Fig. 4 A,B.
However, GARP does not allow determination of which variables contributed more to the best models.

Discussion
Phylogenetic position of Cyanaeorchis
Our phylogenetic analysis clearly supports inclusion of Cyanaeorchis in Catasetinae, among which it is
strongly supported as sister to Grobya (BP 100, PP 1.00). From this result, it is clear that all earlier phylogenetic
positions of Cyanaeorchis among Eulophiinae based on an interpretation of its general floral morphology were
mistaken. However, as with the previous inclusion of Cyanaeorchis in Eulophiinae, there are no obvious or
unequivocal morphological characters shared by Cyanaeorchis and the other genera in Catasetinae. For instance,
Grobya and most species of Catasetinae are epiphytic and have pseudobulbs, whereas Cyanaeorchis is terrestrial
and lacks pseudobulbs. The only species of Catasetinae with some similarity to Cyanaeorchis are the terrestrial
Galeandra species, which have a similar vegetative morphology. In accordance with this similarity, Schlechter
(1915) placed Cyanaeorchis and Galeandra in Polystachyinae along with and a few other genera, but he defined
this subtribe based mainly on pollinarium morphology. Like Cyanaeorchis, the terrestrial species of Galeandra are

found in grassland habitats, but this similarity may be, however, just convergence due to similar habitats.
Accordingly, the molecular phylogenetic analysis of Galeandra (Monteiro et al. 2010) indicated that the terrestrial
habit is a derived character in this genus.

Because Catasetinae are restricted to the Neotropics, our results reveal a geographical pattern, not one based on
morphological similarity. The geographical structure of Catasetinae along with the habit and habitat of the species
suggests divergent local diversification of the group in the Neotropics from a common American ancestor. Core
Catasetinae (Catasetum, Clowesia, Cycnoches, Dressleria, and Mormodes), Grobya and one group of Galeandra
species are mainly epiphytic in tropical forests, whereas Cyanaeorchis and another group of Galeandra species are
grassland terrestrial. There are a few exceptions, such as terrestrial Galeandra beyrichii Reichenbach (1850: 854)
that occurs in forests, and a few terrestrial species of Catasetum Richard in Kunth (1822: 330). Because most
species of Catasetinae and Cymbidieae have pseudobulbs, the lack of pseudobulbs in Cyanaeorchis is most likely a
derived character and an adaptation to permanently water-saturated soil. In contrast, the grassland terrestrial
species of Galeandra grow in seasonally humid or dry soils and have pseudobulbs.
Beyond the lack of pseudobulbs and terminal inflorescence, four pollinia in Cyanaeorchis is another distinctive
feature that differs from other genera in Catasetinae and Eulophiinae. Nevertheless, the number of pollinia is a
variable character in other genera in the tribe; for example, Cymbidium Swartz (1799: 70) can have two or four
pollinia (Seidenfaden 1983). In summary, our results suggest that the modified vegetative morphology of
Cyanaeorchis compared to other Catasetinae reflects an adaption to moist grasslands. Differences in flower
features are most likely also adaptations to specific pollinators. Nothing is known about pollination of
Cyanaeorchis, but the three species in the genus have papillae in the labellum midlobe. This feature is also found in
several species of Eulophia. Pollination by carpenter bees of the genus Xylocopa has been reported for Eulophia,
and it is possible that Cyanaeorchis may have a similar pollinator.
Inclusion of Cyanaeorchis in Catasetinae requires a morphological change to circumscription in the latter, but
this was true also of inclusion of Grobya and Galeandra in this subtribe. However, there are no apparent common
morphological characters shared among genera in the subtribe, except for homoblastic pseudobulbs, which also
occur in other subtribes and tribes (Pridgeon et al. 2009). Consequently more detailed comparisons, including
additional data from anatomy, cytogenetics, palynology, phytochemistry etc. will be necessary to reassess the
phylogenetic position of Cyanaeorchis, Grobya and Galeandra in Catasetinae, which is supported by molecular
but not morphological characters.
Relationships within Catasetinae were not completely resolved, particularly in relation to the position of
Galeandra, which varied in each analysis. In the analysis of the combined datasets Galeandra was a sister to core
Catasetinae, in the analyses of the plastid dataset it was a sister to a Catasetum–Clowesia clade, whereas in the
analyses of the ITS dataset it formed a polytomy with Grobya–Cyanaeorchis and core Catasetinae.
Phylogenetic relationships in Cymbidieae
Although our study was not designed to resolve relationships in Cymbidieae, some results concerning major
relationships in the tribe and differences from the literature deserve some mention. In all our analyses, Cymbidiinae
were recovered as a sister to the remaining subtribes of Cymbidieae, with the exception of the parsimony analysis
of the ITS dataset, in which Geodorum (Eulophiinae) was a sister to the remainder of the tribe. In the combined
analysis, Cyrtopodiinae were sister to Cymbidieae exclusing Cymbidiinae. All analyses also recovered the clade
composed of Eriopsidinae, Zygopetalinae, Oncidiinae, Maxillariinae, Coeliopsidinae and Stanhopeinae, but
relationships between subtribes were not resolved. In the ITS and combined analyses, Zygopetalinae were a sister
to Oncidiinae, Coeliopsidinae sister to Stanhopeinae, and Coeliopsidinae-Stanhopeinae sister to Maxillariinae. The
position of Eriopsidinae was not resolved.
Some results obtained were not in agreement with the literature. In our analyses, Ansellia and Graphorkis were
more closely related to Eulophiinae, whereas in Genera orchidacearum (Pridgeon et al. 2009), they were placed in
Cymbidiinae. The two first genera are from Africa, and in a biogeographical context, their inclusion in Eulophiinae
makes more sense because Eulophiinae are predominantly Afro-Madagascan whereas Cymbidiinae are almost
entirely from tropical and subtropical Asia. In this context, the monospecific genus Imerinaea Schlechter (1925:
152), from Madagascar, is most likely more related to Eulophiinae than to Cymbidiinae. The position of Dipodium
warrants further investigation. In our analysis of the plastid dataset, it was strongly to moderately supported (1.00
PP; 71 BP) as sister to Cymbidieae, excluding Cymbidiinae. The same result was obtained in the parsimony
analysis of Górniak et al. (2010) using the low-copy nuclear gene Xdh. However, in Genera orchidacearum
(Pridgeon et al. 2009), Dipodium was placed in the subtribe Cymbidiinae, indicating that the phylogenetic position
of the genus is not clear and requires further investigation.

Distribution of the species of Cyanaeorchis
There is no overlap between the known or potential distribution areas of C. praetermissa and C. minor (Fig.
4A, B). Cyanaeorchis praetermissa occurs in the cerrado biome in the highlands of central-western and
southeastern Brazil at an elevation of 1000–1400 m, whereas C. minor occupies the southernmost part of the Mata
Atlântica domain at elevations of 700–900 m. Although the method (GARP) used to model potential distribution of
these species does not specify which variables contributed more to the model, a comparison of the climatic data for
the predicted areas suggests that the species have different ecological niches. Cyanaeorchis praetermissa occurs in
locations with a marked seasonality, the highest precipitation of wettest quarter (mean of 863 mm vs. 594 mm for
C. minor), lowest precipitation of the coldest quarter (mean of 53 mm vs. 200 mm for C. minor) and higher
isothermality. On the other hand, the known and potential distribution of C. arundinae encompasses those of C.
minor and C. praetermissa over an elevation range of 4–1800 m. The mean temperature of the coldest quarter
(15.1°C for the sampled locations vs. 16.7 °C for C. minor and 18.2 °C for C. praetermissa) and precipitation of
warmest quarter were the bioclimatic variables that most contributed to the niche model of C. arundinae, but its
wide distribution indicates that this species likewise has broader climatic tolerance. Overall, the mean values of the
bioclimate variables were more similar for the sampled sites of C. arundinae and C. minor, and sites of C.
praetermissa were different from that of those two.
Our field observations also indicate differences in the specific habitat preferences of C. praetermissa and the
other two species. All three species occur in hydromorphic, water-saturated soil, but C. praetermissa occurs in
areas where the herb cover is thinner and less developed and the soil is stable. In contrast, C. arundinae and C.
minor occur in areas with a taller herb cover, usually over soft, unstable soil, and such areas are generally referred
to as “brejos.” Although the known (and predicted) distribution of C. arundinae encompasses the distribution of C.
praetermissa, we are not aware of any place in which the two species co-occur. Conversely, C. arundinae and C.
minor co-occur in some sites.
Distribution models predicted larger areas of occurrence for the three species, particularly for C. arundinae.
According to our results, this species should also be expected in Bolivia, the southeastern Brazilian states of Rio de
Janeiro and Espirito Santo and several areas in northeastern Brazil, including the Borborema Plateaux and Chapada
do Araripe in the states of Pernambuco and Ceará. The only known record of this species from northeastern Brazil
so far is from the Chapada Diamantina in Bahia (Toscano de Brito et al. 2005).

Taxonomy
Two species of Cyanaeorchis are accepted, C. arundinae and C. minor (Hoehne 1942, Pabst & Dungs 1975, Barros
et al. 2013, Govaerts et al. 2013). Differences between these two species are size of plants and flowers and colour
of the labellum. Plants of C. arundinae are usually taller with larger flowers that are completely yellow, whereas C.
minor has smaller plants and flowers with a whitish perianth and wine-coloured lateral lobes of the labellum.
However, there are no unique characteristics for either of the species because these characteristics overlap (Table
3), and the exact separation between them is not clear. Hoehne (1942) accepted the existence of two species but
suggested that C. minor could correspond to stunted specimens of C. arundinae.
In terms of distribution, C. arundinae is the most widespread species, occurring from the Espinhaço range in
the state of Bahia in northeastern Brazil to central (Distrito Federal, Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul),
southeastern (Minas Gerais, São Paulo), southern Brazil (Paraná, Santa Catarina, Rio Grande do Sul), Argentina
(Chaco and Buenos Aires) and Paraguay (Amambay, Caaguazú, Canindeyú and Misiones). Cyanaeorchis minor is
found in southern (Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul), southeastern (São Paulo) and central (Goiás) Brazil, and
Paraguay (Caaguazú). Some authors have also recorded C. arundinae in the Amazon region and the state of Rio de
Janeiro in southeastern Brazil (Hoehne 1942, Pabst & Dungs 1975, Barros et al. 2013), but there are no herbarium
specimens known from these regions.
Small plants of Cyanaeorchis from central Brazil were previously identified as C. minor by Pabst & Dungs
(1975), Menezes (1992, 2004), Batista & Bianchetti (2003) and Batista et al. (2005) because of the small size of the
plants and flowers. However, examination of images of syntypes of C. minor in the herbarium of the Swedish
Museum of Natural History (S) and several specimens of C. minor from other herbaria (AMES, BHCB, G, HBG,
M, NY, SP, SPF) has shown that plants from central Brazil are a new species distinct from C. minor, described here
as C. praetermissa.

extend onto the midlobe from the base to about the middle of the median part with numerous minute papillae,
immediately before the midlobe with a flat, short, glabrous, longitudinally slightly grooved callus; midlobe 2.0–3.0
× 2.0–2.5 mm, base attenuate, apex orbicular to suborbicular, rounded, curved downwards, verrucose, verrucae
concentrated at base or middle of midlobe, margins crenulate. Gynostemium erect, half-terete, slightly arcuate,
5.7–7.2 × 1.3–1.5 mm, foot absent, base reddish with small, rounded, lateral wings on each side, greenish or
yellowish toward apex; anther terminal, incumbent, deciduous, membranous, ovate, transversally depressed, ca.
1.3 × 1.5 mm, yellowish; pollinia four, waxy, yellow, in two pairs, each pair with one larger, ca. 0.85 × 0.70 mm,
flat, roundish, concave, forming a groove that fits the smaller pollinia, the other smaller, 0.70 × 0.60 mm; viscidium
not seen; stigma ventral, entire, oblong, yellowish, slightly convex. Fruit fusiform, at one month old 2.5 × 0.6 cm.
Distribution and Conservation Status:—Restricted to the cerrado biome in central and southeastern Brazil in
the states of Goiás and Minas Gerais and the Federal District (Fig. 4A). The species is known from 13 collections at
seven localities. Most collections and some of the larger known populations of the species are from the Federal
District, where the species seem to be most threatened. The population at Setor Mansões Park Way has been
destroyed, whereas large populations at Santuário Ecologico do Riacho Fundo and Reserva Ecológica do Guará
have been severely depleted in the last 20 years due to alterations in habitat quality. Based on the World
Conservation Union Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2001), C. praetermissa can be tentatively classified as
Vulnerable (VU) (criteria A2ac; B2ab (ii, iii, iv); C2a(i)).
Habitat and Ecology:—Cyanaeorchis praetermissa grows in permanently wet grassland, campo limpo
úmido, according to the classification of Ribeiro & Walter (2008), over dark, water-saturated, hydromorphic soil,
usually near the border of flooded gallery forests (Fig. 5A) or in veredas (grasslands with buriti palms), 1000–1400
meters above sea level. Vegetative and reproductive growth are associated with rainfall, and blooming occurs at the
beginning of the rainy season, from October to early December. Blooming appears to be strictly related to
brushfires that occur during the dry season. All collections of the species made by the authors (12 of the 13 known
collections) were made in recently burned areas. The species is sympatric with, and flowers at about the same time
as, other orchid species, such as Veyretia simplex (Grisebach 1864: 641) Szlachetko (1995: 116), Habenaria
edwallii Cogniaux (1906 publ. 1907: 275), H. balansae Cogniaux (1906 publ. 1907: 271), Gomesa hydrophila
(Barbosa Rodrigues 1877: 92) Chase & Williams (2009: 397), G. barbaceniae (Lindley 1855: 32) Chase &
Williams (2009: 395), Epidendrum dendrobioides Thunberg (1818: 17), Cleistes castaneoides Hoehne (1939: 42)
and Cyrtopodium fowliei Menezes (1995: 17), all also typically found in habitats with water-saturated soil.
Populations of Cyanaeorchis praetermissa usually form compact groups with large number of specimens, whereas
C. arundinae and C. minor are usually found as scattered individuals or a few plants.
Etymology:—From Latin, meaning overlooked or neglected, in reference to the new species having been
overlooked by previous taxonomists.
Illustrations:—Pabst & Dungs (1975, pg. 381, fig. 1645, based on Heringer 9202, HB), Menezes (1992,

Notes:—As far as we could determine, C. praetermissa was first collected by Heringer in Brasília in 1963.
Material of this collection was examined by Pabst, who misidentified it as C. minor and published a sketch of a
flower from this collection in his seminal work of Brazilian orchids, Orchidaceae Brasilienses (Pabst & Dungs
1975). This mistake was followed by all subsequent authors who examined and identified material of the species
(Menezes 1992, 2004, Batista & Bianchetti 2003, Batista et al. 2005) or compiled data on the distribution of the
genus (Barros et al. 2013, Govaerts et al. 2013).
Cyanaeorchis praetermissa is the smallest of the three species in the genus (Fig. 6). In terms of size, number
and size of leaves and number of flowers, C. praetermissa overlaps C. minor and small individuals of C.
arundinae. In size of sepals and petals, C. praetermissa overlaps C. minor. The main distinctive characteristics are
size of the labellum and papillae. In C. praetermissa, the labellum is shorter and straighter (6.0–8.0 × 4.5–6.5 mm,
versus 8.0–12.0× 9.0 mm in C. minor and 9.0–15.0 × 9.0–12.0 mm in C. arundinae), and papillae are shorter.
Another difference in C. minor is floral colour. Cyanaeorchis praetermissa has completely yellow flowers, whereas
C. minor has whitish sepals and petals and wine-coloured lateral lobes of the labellum. Other differences between
the three species are outlined in Table 3.
