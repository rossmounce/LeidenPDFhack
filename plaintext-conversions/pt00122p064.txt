Abstract
The misapplication of the name Tectaria griffithii is corrected, which results in the revival of T. multicaudata and the
proposal of a new combination (T. multicaudata var. amplissima) and two new synonyms (T. yunnanensis and T.
multicaudata var. singaporeana). For the reduction of Psomiocarpa and Tectaridium (previously monotypic genera) into
Tectaria, T. macleanii (new combination) and T. psomiocarpa (new name) are proposed as new combinations. In
addition, the new name Tectaria subvariolosa is put forward to replace a later homonym (T. stenosemioides).
Key words: nomenclature, Psomiocarpa, taxonomy, Tectaridium

Introduction
Tectaria Cavanilles (1799) (Tectariaceae) is a fern genus frequent in tropical regions, with most species
growing terrestrially in rain forests. This group is remarkable for its extremely diverse morphology, and the
estimated number of species ranges from 150 (Tryon & Tryon 1982; Kramer 1990) to 210 (Holttum 1991a).
Holttum (1991a) recognized 105 species in Tectaria from Malesia and presumed that SE Asia is its center of
origin. In SE Asia outside Malesia, the exact number of species in Tectaria remains unknown due to lack of a
modern treatment since the first revision for the area (Ching 1931). Though several regional revisions were
carried out in last decades (e.g., Tagawa & Iwatsuki 1988, Wang 1999, Chandra 2000), the delimitation of
Tectaria, especially the species concept, is different from author to author.
During an attempt to revise the taxonomy of Tectaria in mainland Asia and to explore the phylogenetic
concept of Tectaria, we have made some studies of herbarium material and simultaneously conducted
phylogenetic analyses based on cpDNA sequences in recent years. Before presenting our molecular results,
we thought it necessary to clarify some confusion on species identities.

Taxonomic treatment
Tectaria griffithii (Baker) C.Christensen (1934: 180).
Basionym:—Nephrodium griffithii Baker in Hooker & Baker (1867: 300). Type:—MYANMAR. Without locality,
without date, Griffith s.n. (holotype K!).
= Nephrodium yunnanense Baker (1906: 11); Tectaria yunnanensis (Baker) Ching (1931: 24), syn. nov. Type:—CHINA.
Yunnan: Mengtze, Red river mountains, without date, Hancock 193 (holotype K!).

Note:—Tectaria griffithii has long been confused with T. multicaudata (Clarke 1880: 540) Ching (1931: 20).
Both Ching (1931) and Holttum (1991a, b) considered the two species as conspecific, albeit Ching (1931)

took T. multicaudata as the accepted name while Holttum (1991a, b) adopted T. griffithii. In fact, T. griffithii
and T. multicaudata are distinct in the venation pattern. The holotype of T. griffithii (Griffith s.n., K) is
characterized by having fully anastomosing veins, vein areoles mostly with free veinlets included, and lacking
costal or costular areoles (Fig. 1a). The holotype of T. multicaudata (Clarke 18427, K) has partly
anastomosing veins that form narrow areoles immediately beside costae or costules, without included free
veinlets (or rarely occurring) in areoles (Fig. 1b). Noticeably, the feature of venation was clearly stated in the
protologues of T. griffithii and T. multicaudata. Baker described the venation of T. griffithii as having “main
veins distinct to the edge, with copious free included veinlets” (Hooker & Baker 1867: 300). For the venation
of T. multicaudata, Clarke stated that “I can see little difference in the venation and sori between this and
Nephrodium cicutarium var. coadunata” (Clarke 1880: 540). As we know, N. cicutarium var. coadunata
mentioned by Clarke is nowadays T. coadunata (Smith 1842: 184) C.Christensen (1931: 331), which is
characterized by veins forming costal and costular areoles lacking free included veinlets (Holttum 1991a).
Unfortunately, later authors ignored the easily recognizable difference of venation between the two species. It
is notable that the venation in such two conditions (costal areoles present or not) is the sole difference between
two sections of Tectaria proposed by Holttum (1988, 1991a). According to Holttum’s subdivision of Tectaria,
T. multicaudata should be grouped into sect. Sagenia, whereas T. griffithii to sect. Tectaria.
Tectaria yunnanensis is included here in T. griffithii. When comparing the holotypes of both species, we
found that they are similar in nearly all important characters, such as coarsely dissected fronds, fully
anastomosing veins without costal or costular areoles, large sori in two rows between main veins, and sori
rather deeply impressed on abaxial surface of lamina. They doubtless represent a single species. It is also
noticed that there are no scales above the base of stipes in this species. Scaly stipes, previously considered a
diagnostic character of T. griffithii (e.g., Holttum 1988, Tagawa & Iwatsuki 1988, Wang 1999), is actually a
characteristic feature of T. multicaudata.
Tectaria macleanii (Copel.) S.Y.Dong, comb. nov.
Basionym:—Tectaridium macleanii Copeland (1926: 329). Type:—PHILIPPINES. Luzon: Cagayan (West Mountain,
Claveria), 29 December 1919, Maclean & Catatan 84 (neotype MICH, isoneotype CAS, all original material
destroyed in 1945 at PNH).
= Tectaridium primitivum Copeland (1926: 329). Type:—PHILIPPINES. Leyte: Buenavista (Jaro), 9 June 1914, Wenzel
876 (holotype PNH, destroyed, isotypes F, MO, NY, UC).

Note:—Tectaridium Copeland (1926: 329) is a monotypic genus in the Philippines (Holttum 1991a). In our
phylogenetic trees based on six cpDNA sequences (Ding et al., unpubl. data), however, the sample of
Tectaridium was well resolved in a monophyletic clade with other Tectaria species. So the transfer of
Tectaridium macleanii into Tectaria is needed.
Tectaria multicaudata (C.B.Clarke) Ching (1931: 20).
Basionym:—Nephrodium multicaudatum Clarke (1880: 540). Type:—BANGLADESH. Sylhet, 30 November 1887,
Clarke 18427 (holotype K!).
Tectaria griffithii auct. non (Baker) Christensen (1934: 180), Holttum (1991a: 54), pro parte, excluding the type of T.
griffithii.
= Tectaria griffithii var. singaporeana Holttum (1991b: 551), syn. nov. Type:—SINGAPORE. Bukit Timah, January
1908, Matthew s.n. (holotype K!).

Note:—As stated above, Tectaria multicaudata is a separate species from T. griffithii. They are distinct in the
venation pattern, i.e., costal and costular areoles are present in T. multicaudata but absent in T. griffithii (Fig. 1).
Holttum (1991b) proposed two varieties under his misunderstood Tectaria griffithii, i.e., T. griffithii var.
singaporeana and T. griffithii var. amplissima, both having costal and costular areoles of veins. The only
difference between the two varieties is “veins all free in lobes of fertile pinnae” in “T. griffithii var.
singaporeana” but “veins amply anastomosing in fertile fronds” in “T. griffithii var. amplissima” (Holttum
1991b). When carefully comparing a large number of specimens of T. multicaudata in herbaria, we found the

form of veins of “T. griffithii var. singaporeana” falling within the variation range of veins of T. multicaudata.
Therefore we propose to include T. griffithii var. singaporeana in T. multicaudata. The holotype of the second
variety, T. griffithii var. amplissima, however, represents a distinct taxon, which is transferred to T.
multicaudata as a variety.
Tectaria malayensis (Christ 1907: 187) Copeland (1907: 416) was submerged by Holttum (1991a) under
his misapplied T. griffithii. It was based on a collection from Luzon (Loher 858, K!) with the same venation
pattern of T. multicaudata. If T. malayensis will be eventually proved to be a synonymous name, it should be
reduced to T. multicaudata instead of T. griffithii.

Portion of a pinnule on basal pinna, based on the holotype of T. griffithii (Griffith s.n., K); b) portion of a pinnule on basal pinna, based
on the holotype of T. multicaudata (Clarke 18427, K).

Tectaria multicaudata var. amplissima (Holttum) S.Y.Dong, comb. nov.
Basionym:—Tectaria griffithii var. amplissima Holttum (1991b: 551). Type:—INDONESIA. Sumatra: Padang Panjang
(Bukit Tilabung), 9 January 1913, Matthew s.n. (holotype K!).

Note:—As Holttum (1991a, b) has pointed out, T. multicaudata var. amplissima has rather finely dissected
fronds with as many as six pairs of pinnules on the basal pinnae. In contrast, the fronds are not so dissected
with only one or rarely two pinnules on basal pinna in T. multicaudata var. multicaudata.
Tectaria psomiocarpa S.Y.Dong, nom. nov. for Polybotrya apiifolia J.Sm. ex Kunze (1844: 142). Psomiocarpa
apiifolia (J.Sm. ex Kunze) Presl (1851: 161). Acrostichum apiifolium (J.Sm. ex Kunze) Hooker (1864: 248).
Type:—PHILIPPINES. Luzon, 1936–1940, Cuming 26 (holotype MICH!, isotypes E!, MO!, P!).
Blocking name:—Tectaria apiifolia (Schkuhr 1809: 198) Copeland (1907: 410). Type:—JAMAICA. Without locality,
Sloane s.n. (holotype? BM!).

Note:—Psomiocarpa C.Presl (1851: 161) is currently an accepted genus containing only one species, P.
apiifolia (Schkuhr) Copeland (1907: 410) (Holttum 1991a). Our molecular analyses (Ding et al., unpubl.
data), however, do not support the monophyly of Psomiocarpa, as P. apiifolia is constantly embedded with
Tectaria species in all resulting phylogenetic trees. Thus, in taxonomic treatment P. apiifolia should be
transferred into Tectaria. Since an earlier T. apiifolia (Schkuhr) Copeland (1907: 410) exists, which is based
on material from Jamaica, we have to propose a new name for P. apiifolia, Tectaria psomiocarpa.
