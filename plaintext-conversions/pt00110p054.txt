Abstract
The genus Microlicia comprises approximately 130 species, the characters that define the species are very often tenuous,
making delimitation between closely related species difficult. As a result of a taxonomic study on Microlicia, 14 new
synonyms are proposed here and 10 lectotypes are designated.

Resumo

frequentemente muito tênues, tornando difícil a delimitação entre as espécies próximas. Como parte dos estudos
taxonômicos do gênero Microlicia, são propostos aqui 14 novos sinônimos e designados 10 lectótipos.

Introduction
Microlicia Don (1823: 301) is a genus of approximately 130 species, 117 of which occur in Brazil, and at least
115 are considered endemic (Romero & Woodgyer 2013). The genus is extremely diverse in the campo
rupestre and savannah vegetation of Bahia, Minas Gerais and Goiás (Romero 2003a).
The last complete monograph of Microlicia was carried out by Cogniaux (1891) nearly 130 years ago. 99
species were recognized in sections Chaetostomoides (Naudin) Cogniaux (1883: 43), Pseudomicrolicia
Cogniaux (1883: 47), and Microlicia (1883: 59). Since then, only section Chaetostomoides has been revised,
it is now monospecific (Romero 2003b). After Cogniaux’s monograph (1891) at least 50 new species were
added to the genus, mostly from the states of Bahia, Minas Gerais and Goiás.
The species of Microlicia are generally characterized by solitary flowers with five or occasionally six
petals; a superior ovary with three or occasionally five locules and capsules dehiscing longitudinally from the
apex to the base (Almeda & Martins 2001; Romero 2003b). Difficulty in the delimitation of closely related
species may explain the high number of names proposed for several species in the genus. Analysis of type
material of 12 binomials and 9 trinomials has allowed lectotypification and new synonymy for some of these
names.

Materials and Methods
This study is based on literature and on the analysis of collections deposited in the following herbaria: BM,
BR, G, K, HUFU, M, MO, NY, P, and W (acronyms according to Thiers 2013).

De Candolle (1828) described Microlicia isophylla based on a specimen from "Brasilia pascuis editis
arenosis montion Minas Geraes", not indicating the name of the collector. The author stated that the
description was based on the manuscript name ‘Rhexia isophylla et uncata of Schrank et Martius’. A
specimen deposited at M herbarium has a handwritten description by Schrank & Martius named Rhexia
isophylla; it is clearly the holotype of M. isophylla.
While describing M. pulchella Chamisso (1834) referred to a collection made by Sellow in Brazil without
citing the number of the collector or the herbarium where it was deposited. The collection examined by
Chamisso (1834) was probably deposited at the B herbarium, destroyed during World War II. Since the author
did not indicate the holotype, the Sellow specimen deposited at K herbarium, is here designated as lectotype
of M. pulchella.
In the protologue of M. doryphylla, Naudin (1845) noted only Ouro Preto as the location of the specimen
collection. Some years later, Naudin (1849) added the name Claussen as collector of this specimen. According
to Martin & Cremers (2007) the specimen Claussen 308 deposited in P should be considered the holotype.
Cogniaux (1883) described M. doryphylla var. puberula based on a part of Claussen 308. The sheet seen
at herbarium BR has two branches: the branch on the right side is glabrous and the branch on the left side has
sparse indumentum, and both match the original description of M. doryphylla and M. doryphylla var.
puberula, respectively.
Cogniaux (1891) described M. doryphylla var. glabra based on two syntypes. Glaziou 17511 at BR is
designated as lectotype, because it is a better representation of the description, clearly showing the characters
mentioned in the protologue. The other syntype, Moura 261, actually does not match the description of M.
doryphylla and may possibly be a new species.

Microlicia isophylla var. laxa was described by Chamisso (1834) to include specimens with flexuous and
much branched stems, without leaves at the base and with a thick leaf blade, and glutinous or not. Microlicia
isophylla var. latifolia was described by Cogniaux (1883) to accommodate specimens with a sparse
arrangement of leaves in the branches and the leaves smaller than the length of the internodes. According to
Cogniaux (1883), M. isophylla var. latifolia has leaves slightly larger (4–6 × 1–2 mm) than the typical form
(3–5 × 0.6–0.7 mm). Leaf characteristics used to describe both varieties are insufficient to maintain the
varieties, and are certainly variations on the typical form.
According to Naudin (1849), M. doryphylla is very similar to M. parvifolia Naudin (1845: 177) and M.
pulchella Chamisso (1834: 392), because the habit is common to all three species. Microlicia pulchella var.
diffusa has few-branched stems, without leaves at the base, M. doryphylla var. puberula presents pubescent
indumentums, in M. doryphylla var. cuneifolia the leaves are obovate with attenuate bases, in M. parvifolia
var. viscosa the leaves are glutinous, and in M. doryphylla var. glabra the branches are glabrous. All of this
variation does not permit the maintenance of these varieties; they are here synonymized under M. isophylla.
Microlicia isophylla is very polymorphic regarding the vegetative and reproductive features. The leaves
are sessile or with a short petiole not exceeding 1 mm long. The leaf blade varies from lanceolate, elliptic to
elliptic-lanceolate, rounded base, sometimes cuneate (M. doryphylla var. cuneifolia). The apex is usually acute
and can present a short thickened tip, which also occurs in the calyx lobes. The stems, leaves, pedicel,
hypanthium and calyx lobes have an indumentum of sessile glands, giving a glutinous aspect to the plant (M.
parvifolia var. viscosa). Occasionally the branches, leaves, pedicel, hypanthium, and calyx lobes present an
indumentum of short, pale trichomes, and the number of trichomes is quite variable (M. doryphylla var.
puberula). Leaves with 3 nerves from the base, not always visible, but the central nerve is always evident and
often in dried material, and is darker than the blade. The margin varies from entire to slightly crenulate and the
pedicel from 1–4 mm long.
The specific epithet isophylla (iso=equal, phylla=leaf) emphasizes the equal size of the leaves on the
branches, since this pattern is often observed in the referred species. Besides the distribution pattern of the
leaves on the branches, M. isophylla can be also recognized by its ascending, lanceolate to elliptic-lanceolate
leaves, with attenuate, rounded, rarely cuneate bases and acute to short-acuminate apices, often with the same
length as the internode, and young branches, leaves, hypanthium, and calyx lobes covered with sessile, golden
glands, occasionally with an indumentum of short, pale trichomes.
Microlicia isophylla is a much branched subshrub 30–50 cm tall, flowers with pedicel ca. 1.5 mm long,
terete hypanthium with triangular-subulate calyx lobes and acute apex. The petals are magenta and the
dimorphic stamens have bicolored anthers.
Microlicia isophylla occurs in campo de altitude, campo rupestre and campo sujo from Minas Gerais, São
Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states.

≡

Cogniaux (1883) considered M. insignis Naudin (1845) a variety of M. linifolia and correctly assigned a new
name (M. linifolia var. naudiniana) since the name M. insignis had been previously used by Schlechtendal
(1834). According to Martin & Cremers (2007), the holotype of M. linifolia var. naudiniana (1883: 63) is at P.
Nevertheless, Naudin (1845) pointed out the specimens are deposited at herb. Mus. Par. Rich. et Deless. (P
and G, respectively), and therefore one specimen deposited in P is designated here as the lectotype of M.
linifolia var. naudiniana, since it is in agreement with the protologue.
Cogniaux (1883) described M. linifolia var. naudiniana as a subshrub 50–70 cm tall, without leaves at the
base, leaf blade 10–15 mm long with a central nerve not evident. These characters, evident in the type
collection are insufficient to recognize this morphology as a variety and can be considered within the normal
variation expected in M. linifolia.
Microlicia linifolia is a branched, xylopodiferous, subshrub ca. 40–60 cm tall, with petiolate leaves
(petiole ca. 1 mm long), lanceolate leaf blade with an attenuate base, acute apex, and covered with sessile,
spherical glands, and the smooth surface. The flowers have a glutinous, campanulate hypanthium with long
calyx lobes, the apex acute and apiculate.
Microlicia linifolia is known only by few collections made more than 120 years ago in Minas Gerais state,
where it seems to be endemic and rare. Efforts have been made to find populations of M. linifolia, mainly in
Biribiri State Park and around Diamantina, Minas Gerais, but without success.

Triana (1873) described Microlicia martiana based on six syntypes: Langsdorff s.n., Claussen 1840, Claussen
36, Clausen 1029, Reise 21 and Martius 915. The collection Martius 915 at K is designated as lectotype,
because it is the most representative, clearly showing the characters mentioned in the protologue.
Microlicia martiana is a subshrub 30–50 cm tall species with fastigiate branches; young branches are
sharply quadrangular, the older terete, glabrescent, without leaves at the base and a bark gradually peeling to
reveal underlying brownish wood. The young branches, leaves, hypanthium and calyx lobes are glutinous,
with sessile, golden glands. The leaves are horizontal, discolored, with a dark green adaxial surface and a
short petiole (0.4–0.6 mm long). The leaf blade is linear-lanceolate, attenuate and 3–nerved at base, with an
acute, sometimes apiculate apex, margin entire or lightly undulating, the midrib is impressed on the adaxial
surface and prominent on the abaxial surface.
Microlicia martiana is endemic to Minas Gerais, occurring in Conceição do Mato Dentro, Itabirito, Nova
Lima and São Roque de Minas, in cerrado, campo rupestre and campo limpo, in sandy soil.

According to Martin & Cremers (2007), the holotype of M. multicaulis is at P. Nevertheless, Naudin (1845)
pointed out the specimens are deposited at herb. Deless. et Mus. Par. (G and P, respectively), and therefore the
specimen deposited in P is designated here as the lectotype of M. multicaulis, since it is in agreement with the
protologue.
In the protologue of M. pseudoscoparia, here synonymized under M. multicaulis, Cogniaux (1883)
indicated that the type collection was deposited in several herbaria (Herb. Berol., Brux., Vindob., and Acad.
Petrop.). The specimen Sellow 1334 at herbarium BR is designated here as lectotype of M. pseudoscoparia,
since it is in good conditions and the characteristics are according to the protologue of the species. The
specimen Sellow 1334 has quadrangular branches with concolorous and ascending leaves, the leaf blade is
linear-lanceolate to lanceolate, attenuate at base, with an acute apex, without arista, barely undulating margin,
and adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaf covered with sessile, spherical glands, these sunken, making the
leaves slightly wrinkled. The leaves have a short petiole ca. 1 mm long and the hypanthium is glutinous,
shining, the calyx lobes are glutinous, lanceolate, acute apex and with the same size of the hypanthium or
slightly longer. These features fall within the morphological variation of M. multicaulis and therefore M.
pseudoscoparia is considered synonymous with M. multicaulis.
Cogniaux (1883) described Microlicia arenariifolia var. riedeliana Cogniaux (1883: 68) based on Riedel
1445 from Serra do Caraça, Minas Gerais state. After examining these collections we concluded that the
specimen fits M. multicaulis Mart. ex Naudin (1845: 184), which was also described from a collection by
Martius in Serra do Caraça. The specimen has ascending leaves with petioles ca. 0.5 mm long, basally
attenuate, linear-lanceolate leaf blades with acute apices and arista ca. 1 mm long, entire margins, and only
one central nerve. Thus, we accept M. arenariifolia De Candolle (1828: 120) as an extra-Brazilian species
occurring in Bolivia and M. arenariifolia var. riedeliana as a synonym of M. multicaulis.
Microlicia arenariifolia is a branched, xylopodiferous subshrub, 40 cm tall with sessile leaves, lanceolate
leaf blades with attenuate bases, acute apices with short arista, and covered with sessile, spherical glands. The
flowers have a glabrous, campanulate hypanthium with calyx lobes shorter than the hypanthium or the same
length, the apex acute and apiculate.
Microlicia multicaulis has close affinity with M. arenariifolia, differing mainly in the leaves that have a
short petiole in the former but are sessile in the latter. The distribution of these species is disjunct with M.
arenariifolia occurring in Bolivia.
Microlicia multicaulis is a subshrub, 40–80 cm tall, with a single or much-branched stem, in the latter

case, with several branches. The older branches are terete, while younger ones are distinctly quadrangular,
glutinous, and glabrescent and leafless at the base, the leaves, hypanthium and calyx lobes covered with
sessile glands. Leaves are ascending and with a short petiole, 0.5–1 mm long. The leaf blade is linearlanceolate to lanceolate, with an attenuate base, entire margin, apices are acute with an apical seta (ca. 1 mm
long), and only one central nerve. The hypanthium is campanulate, striate and glutinous, with triangularlanceolate calyx lobes with acute apices with a long, apical seta.

Chamisso (1834) described Microlicia myrtoidea based on two syntypes. Lhotzky’s specimen could not be
found, and Sellow s.n. is designated here as lectotype of M. myrtoidea, since it is in agreement with the
protologue of the species.
Microlicia myrtoidea is a branched, subshrub, c. 50 cm tall. The leaves are ovate-lanceolate, with 3, rarely
5, abaxially evident nerves from the base, leaf bases are rounded, apices acute, with short thickened tips, the
short petioles (ca. 0.2 mm long) are flattened. The young branches, leaves, hypanthia and calyx lobes are
