Abstract
Deniquelata barringtoniae gen. et sp. nov. (Montagnulaceae) forms numerous ascomata on distinct zonate leaf spots of
Barringtonia asiatica (Lecythidaceae). We isolated this taxon and sequenced the 18S and 28S nrDNA. The result of
phylogenetic analysis based on 18S and 28S nrDNA sequence data indicate that the genus belongs in the family
Montagnulaceae, Dothideomycetes, Ascomycota. The ascomata are immersed, dark brown to black, with bitunicate asci
and brown, muriform ascospores. Deniquelata is distinguished from the other genera in Montagnulaceae based on its
short, broad, furcate and pedicellate asci, verruculose ascospores with short narrow pseudoparaphyses with parasitic
naturee and this is also supported by molecular data. A new genus and species is therefore introduced to accommodate
this taxon. We used isolates of this species to show via pathogenicity testing that the taxon is able to cause leaf spots
when leaves are pin pricked.
Key words: Dothideomycetes, foliar pathogen, Montagnulaceae, new genus, new species

Introduction
Among the classes of Ascomycota, Dothideomycetes is the largest and most diverse (Kirk et al. 2008, Zhang
et al. 2012) and is characterized by bitunicate, usually fissitunicate asci (Schoch et al., 2009). The majority of
members in this class are endophytes, epiphytes or saprobes with a small number occurring as lichens and
hyperparasites (Kirk et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2012). Many, especially asexual or mitosporic Dothideomycetes,
are agents of plant diseases, causing serious problems to crop plants (Manamgoda et al. 2011, Wikee et al.
2011).
Besides marine and freshwater fungi (Suetrong et al. 2010), there have been a few taxonomic studies of
Dothideomycetes of Thailand. Boonmee et al. (2011) illustrated new collections of Tubeufiaceae, including a
new genus Chlamydotubeufia based on dictyochlamydosporous anamorphs and three new species; one each in
Acanthostigma, Tubeufia and Thaxteriella based on phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequence data (Boonmee
et al. 2011). Based on combined dataset of 18S and 28S nrDNA sequences, Chomnunti et al. (2011)
introduced Phragmocapnias asiaticus, P. longicollus, P. penzigii, P. siamensis, Leptoxyphium cacuminum and
Capnodium coartatum in the family Capnodiaceae and epitypified the genus Phragmocapnias with a new
collection of P. betle. Liu et al. (2011) reported two new genera, Fussiroma and Neoastrosphaeriella, in
Aigialaceae, based on their distinguishing morphology and molecular phylogeny.

Barringtonia asiatica is commonly distributed in tropics. All plant parts of this species are poisonous and
seeds are commercially used as a fish poison. The leaf decoction of B. asiatica is used to treat stomach-aches
and rheumatism, whereas seeds are known to be wormicidal (http://www.naturia.per.sg/buloh/plants/
sea_poison.htm; Accession date: 21 June 2012).
We have been sampling Dothideomycete species from various hosts and substrates in northern Thailand
(Boonmee et al. 2011, 2012, Chomnunti et al. 2011, 2012, Lui et al. 2011), since 2010. In this paper, we
introduce a new genus Deniquelata found associated with necrotic lesions on leaves of Barringtonia asiatica,
based on morphological and molecular studies. The new genus is compared with other genera in the family
Montagnulaceae.

Material and Methods
Sample collection and specimen examination
Samples included fresh, living leaves of Barringtonia asiatica (Lecythidaceae), gathered from the garden of
the senior author (K.D. Hyde) at 31M. 17, Baan Khuakhae, near Bandu, Muang District, Chiang Rai Province,
Thailand, in 2011 and 2012. Material was brought to the laboratory in Zip lock plastic bags and examined
under a Motic SMZ 168 dissecting microscope for fungal fruiting bodies. Hand sections of the fruiting
structures were mounted in water for microscopic studies and photomicrography. The fungus was examined in
a Nikon ECLIPSE 80i compound microscope and photographed by a Canon 450D digital camera fitted to the
microscope. Measurements were made with the Tarosoft (R) Image Frame Work program and images used for
figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended version 10.0 software (Adobe Systems Inc., The
United States). Following a modified method of Chomnunti et al. (2011), isolations were made from single
ascospores. Contents of the sectioned fruiting body were transferred to a drop of sterile water on a flamesterilized slide. Drops of the spore suspension were pipetted and spread on a Petri-dish containing 2% water
agar (WA) and incubated at 25°C overnight. Germinated ascospores were transferred singly to MEA media
(Alves et al. 2006, Liu et al. 2011).
The type material is deposited in the herbarium of Mae Fah Luang University (MFLU), Chiang Rai,
Thailand and cultures are deposited at the Mae Fah Luang University Culture Collection (MFLUCC),
BIOTEC Culture Collection (BCC) and the International Fungal Research & Development Centre, Kunming,
China (IFRD), the latter under Material Transfer Agreement No. 4/2010 (MTA).
Pathogenicity test
An agar plug (1 cm diam) with mycelium was cut from the periphery of 20 day-old culture grown on Malt
extract agar (MEA) medium (27°C). In vitro pathogenicity testing was carried out on 12 healthy leaves of
Barringtonia asiatica obtained from the original collection site at Bandu, Chiang Rai; the upper and lower
surfaces of leaves were sterilized with 70% ethanol. The leaves were separated into three groups, each with
four leaves. The first group of leaves was wounded by pin-pricking and inoculated by tiny agar plugs (1 cm
diam) with fungal mycelium. Agar plugs with fungal mycelium were placed on the surface of second group
containing unwounded leaves. The third group of leaves was not pin-pricked and was inoculated with MEA
agar plugs without fungal mycelium (control). The inoculated test leaves were maintained in sterile, moist
plastic boxes for 14 days. Observations on the development of disease symptoms were made on a daily basis.
The fungus was reisolated from the inoculated leaves producing symptoms.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
Fungal isolates were grown on MEA for 28 days at 25°C in the dark. Genomic DNA was extracted from the
growing mycelium using the Biospin Fungus Genomic DNA Extraction Kit (BioFlux®) following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Hangzhou, P.R. China).

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using known primer pairs NS1 and NS4 were used to
amplify a region spanning the small subunit rDNA (White et al. 1990). LROR and LR5 primer pairs were
used to amplify a segment of the large subunit rDNA (Vilgalys & Hester 1990) and internal transcribed
spacers (JX254654) was amplified by primer pairs ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990). The amplification
procedure was performed in a 50 l reaction volume containing 5–10 ng DNA, 0.8 units Taq polymerase, 1
PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.3 M of each primer with 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Cai et al. 2009). Amplification
conditions were setup for initial denaturation of 5 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at
48°C and 90 s at 72°C, and a final extension period of 10 min at 72°C (Phillips et al. 2008). The PCR products
were observed on 1% agarose electrophoresis gels stained with ethidium bromide. Purification and
sequencing of PCR products were carried at Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology & Services
Co., Ltd (China).

Phylogenetic analysis
Blast searches were made to reveal the closest matches in GenBank. Sequences were aligned using Bioedit
(Hall 1999) and ClustalX 1.83 (Thompson et al. 1997) and further analyzed manually. PAUP4.0b10 was used
to conduct the parsimony analysis to obtain the phylogenetic trees. Trees were inferred using the heuristic
search option with 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were setup to 500 and branches of zero length
were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony Tree
Length [TL], Consistency Index [CI], Retention Index [RI], Relative Consistency Index [RC] and Homoplasy
Index [HI] were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. Kishino-Hasegawa tests
(KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa 1989) were performed in order to determine whether trees were significantly
different. Trees were figured in Treeview (Page 1996).

Results
Phylogeny of combined 18S and 28S nrDNA
The combined 18S and 28S nrDNA data set comprised 27 taxa including the new strains of Deniquelata
barringtoniae, with Dothidea sambuci as the outgroup taxon and consisted of 1961 characters; of which 1673
characters were constant, 118 variable characters were parsimony-informative and 170 characters were
parsimony-uninformative. Two MP trees were generated and the first of the most parsimonious tree was
selected (FIG. 1), KHT showed length = 508 steps, CI = 0.671, RI = 0.759, RC = 0.510 and HI = 0.329.
The 27 taxa analyzed in the cladogram formed four familial clades, i.e. Didymellaceae, Pleosporaceae,
Massarinaceae and Montagnulaceae. The two isolates of the new genus Deniquelata clustered in the family
Montagnulaceae but were separated from other genera of the family in a clade with a relatively high bootstrap
value (77%).
Taxonomy
The genus Deniquelata, typified by D. barringtoniae, is introduced in the family Montagnulaceae. The new
taxon is well differentiated from other genera in the family based on molecular phylogeny and morphology.
The morphological characters also differentiated Deniquelata barringtoniae from other genera in the family,
as discussed below.

Deniquelata Ariyawansa & K.D. Hyde, gen. nov.
MycoBank MB 800703
Etymology: The generic epithet is from the combination of two Latin words denique and lata, meaning short
and broad, in reference to the asci having a short, broad pedicel.

found to be identical with the original strain and thus confirmed its pathogenicity. No symptoms were
observed on leaves inoculated by agar plugs with fungal mycelium but without wounding and also in the case
of controls. The experiment was carried out using four replicates and repeated three times. In all cases, the
results were similar.

Discussion
Barr (2001) introduced a new family, Montagnulaceae in the order Pleosporales (the largest of the
Dothideomycetes, comprising almost 25% of the species) for genera and species with ascomata immersed
under a clypeus and having pseudoparenchymatous peridium with small cells, cylindrical or oblong,
fissitunicate, pedicellate asci and brown, muriform ascospores. Three genera, viz. phragmosporous Kalmusia,
dictyosporous Montagnula and didymosporous Didymosphaerella were recognized (Barr 2001). Combined
analysis of LSU, SSU, RBP2 and TEF1 genes, however, has shown Montagnulaceae to comprise the genera
Bimuria, Didymocrea, Kalmusia, Karstenula, Montagnula, Didymosphaerella and Paraphaeosphaeria. Some
species of Phaeosphaeria, Paraconiothyrium and Letendraea also cluster in Montagnulaceae and this family
now accommodates species which are saprobic in terrestrial or aquatic environments (Schoch et al. 2009,
Zhang et al. 2009, 2012, Lumbsch & Huhndorf 2010).
The phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of combined 18S and 28S nrDNA provides good
evidence that Deniquelata belongs in Montagnulaceae, where it forms a distinct clade representing the new
genus separated parallel from other genera of the family with a high bootstrap value (77%) (FIG. 1).
Deniquelata differs considerably from the type of Montagnula (M. infernalis) both in the phylogenetic tree
and also morphologically. Deniquelata is a pathogenic genus with fruiting bodies scattered in the necrotic host
tissues. Ascomata are immersed, with a relatively thin peridium (2−5 µm) comprising 2−3 layers of small,
thick-walled cells of textura angularis, fusing at the outside with the host tissues. Pseudoparaphyses are
relatively wide (1−3 µ m) and dense, asci have broad, short, bifurcate pedicels, and ascospores are
conspicuously reddish brown at maturity. In Montagnula infernalis ascomata are clustered in circular groups
on leaves, with a much thicker (40–55 m), brown to dark-brown peridium comprising two distinct layers,
asci have long stretching pedicels and ascospores are brown (Zhang et al. 2012). Bimuria, a monotypic genus
represented by B. novae-zelandiae (Hawksworth et al. 1979, Zhang et al. 2009), occurs in terrestrial
environment as a saprobe and differs from Deniquelata in having asci with short and small knob-like pedicel
and ascospores without vertical septum and verrucose wall (Zhang et al. 2012). Deniquelata differs from
Kalmusia (typified by K. ebuli), by long, narrowed, asci with a furcate pedicel and ascospores having a
verruculose wall and 3 distosepta (Zhang et al. 2012). A synopsis of characters of genera of Montagnulaceae
is provided in Table 1. Pathogenicity test results showed that Deniquelata caused lesion on pin-pricked leaves
of Barringtonia asiatica, indicating that Deniquelata is probably an opportunistic pathogen.
