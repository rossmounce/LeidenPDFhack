Abstract
Kappa carrageenan is an important phycocolloid extracted from the red seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii. This species
has been introduced into several regions, most recently in Brazil. The remote invasive potential of this seaweed in both
south and southeast waters of Brazil (subtropical regions) has been established, but introduction in the northeastern
tropical area is contested due to the absence of biological information. An unknown exotic lineage of K. alvarezii has
been illegally introduced and cultivated in an area characterized by the presence of coral reefs in Paraíba, the
northeastern Brazilian coast, since the beginning of the last decade. This work focuses on the molecular identification of
these samples in comparison with sequences of other strains of K. alvarezii and congeners available in Genbank.
Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian inference (BI) analyses showed strong similarities between K. alvarezii
cultivated in the tropical waters in Brazil and those lineages cultivated in Hawaii, Venezuela, Malaysia and Tanzania that
have never shown invasive behavior. However, more detailed investigations and use of environmental monitoring are
recommended before commercial cultivation of this species can be authorized in tropical region of Brazil.

Introduction
Seaweed farming has an important role in the development of sustainable mariculture and represents an
alternative livelihood for fishers (Ask & Azanza 2002, Oliveira & Paula 2003, Bindu & Levine 2011, Bixer &
Porse 2011). The worldwide production of economically important macroalgae has increased significantly in
recent decades, from 3.8 million tons in 1990 to 19 million tons in 2010; however, in 2008, the total value of
farmed algae was ca. of US$ 4.4 billion, and its value increased to US$ 5.7 billion in 2010 (FAO 2012).
Among these seaweeds, the genera Kappaphycus M.S.Doty in Abbott (1988: 171) and Eucheuma J. Agardh
(1847: 16) (Rhodophyta, Solieriaceae), which are also known as eucheumatoid algae, have been cultivated
worldwide as the primary source of carrageenan (Doty 1985, Areces 1995, Ask et al. 2003, Hayashi et al.
2010). Kappaphycus alvarezii (M.S. Doty 1985: 37) M.S. Doty ex P.C. Silva in Silva et al. (1996: 333) is the
most cultivated seaweed in the world (Ask & Azanza 2002, Aguilan et al. 2003, Hayashi et al. 2007a, 2010,
Bindu & Levine 2011, Bixler & Porse 2011). The cultivation of K. alvarezii began in the 1970s in the
Philippines, and currently it has been introduced to more than 20 countries for mariculture purposes (Doty &
Alvarez 1975, Doty 1985, Areces 1995, Ask & Azanza 2002, Ask et al. 2003).

In Brazil, Kappaphycus alvarezii was introduced in 1995 when it was brought to São Paulo, southeast
region, from the Usa Marine Biological Institute, Kochi University, Japan. All programs involved in the
evaluation of the economic feasibility and the environmental risks of introducing K. alvarezii for the
mariculture were authorized by the Governmental Agency Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos
Recursos Naturais Renováveis (IBAMA) (Paula et al. 1999). Experimental studies have focused on the
introduction of the species and the resulting environmental risks in southeast and south Brazil (Paula et al.
1999, 2002, Bulboa & Paula 2005, Bulboa et al. 2008, Castelar et al. 2009, Góes & Reis 2011, 2012, Hayashi
et al. 2011). Thus, following 18 years of research, the results showed favorable characteristics for commercial
cultivation such as productivity and remote potential invasion (Paula et al. 1999, 2002, Bulboa & Paula 2005,
Bulboa et al. 2008, Hayashi et al. 2007a, b, 2010, 2011, Castelar et al. 2009, Góes & Reis 2011, 2012). Based
on these results, the cultivation of K. alvarezii in limited area of southeast Brazil was authorized by IBAMA
through the Normative Instruction 185/2008. Currently, commercial scale production of K. alvarezii occurs
only along the coast of Rio de Janeiro, a subtropical region of Brazil (Castelar et al. 2009, Góes & Reis 2011,
2012).
In the northeastern Brazilian coast, some seaweed species harvested from the native population are
exploited commercially by fishing communities (Oliveira & Miranda 1998, Bezerra & Marinho-Soriano
2010). The seaweed species of greatest interest are Gracilaria birdiae E.M. Plastino & E.C. Oliveira (2002:
390) and Hydropuntia caudata (J. Agardh 1852: 598) C.F.D. Gurgel & S. Fredericq (2004: 155), and
consequently, the natural populations of these species are reduced to a few individuals who have lost the
ability to recover (Miranda et al. 2012).
In the state of Paraíba, the cultivation initiatives of Gracilaria birdiae and Hydropuntia caudata have
been developed since 1983 (Oliveira & Miranda 1998). However, native seaweed production has not been
economically attractive due to low growth rates of the algae and the difficulty to find seedlings. In the early
2000s, K. alvarezii was irregularly introduced for mariculture purposes in this area only once, and since then
the seaweeds are been cultivated illegally at small scale by local fishermen (Lucena et al. 2007). The
introduction started up with approximately 100 kg of the seaweeds without quarantine procedure and
environmental monitoring (pers. comm. Marivaldo Bastos, local fisherman). The exact origin of this material
is unknown.
It is known that the introduction of exotic species can cause serious environmental damage, including the
loss of native biodiversity (Schaffelke et al. 2006, Anderson 2007, Pickering et al. 2007). Kappaphycus
species such as K. alvarezii and K. striatum (F. Schmitz 1895: 151, 152) M.S. Doty ex P.C. Silva in Silva et al.
(1996: 334) and Eucheuma spp. have been reported in bioinvasion events in Hawaii (Smith et al. 2002,
Conklin & Smith 2005), India (Bagla 2008, Chandrasekaran et al. 2008, Kamalakannan et al. 2010) and
Venezuela (Barrios 2005, Barrios et al. 2007). In addition, recently Halling et al. (2013) observed K. alvarezii,
which was introduced from Asia for mariculture purposes, growing on coral reefs in Zanzibar.
The taxonomy of eucheumatoid species is difficult due to strong morphological plasticity, causing the
misapplication of commercial and scientific names (Doty 1985, 1988). Zuccarello et al. (2006), Conklin et al.
(2009) and Tan et al. (2012) have highlighted the need for more detailed studies to confirm the identity of
target seaweeds and to access genotype information before seaweed strains can be used for mariculture
purposes. Molecular approaches have been widely used to certify the identification of strains with high
commercial value and low bioinvasion potential. Molecular markers such as the mitochondrial-encoded cox1
gene, a portion of the nuclear 28S rRNA gene (LSU), the small subunit rRNA gene (SSU), the Universal
Plastid Amplicon (UPA) and the large subunit of the chloroplast-encoded gene (rbcL) are more suitable for
identification and phylogenetic analysis (Lluisma & Ragen 1995, Fredericq et al. 1999, Conklin et al. 2009,
Tan et al. 2012), whereas for inter- and intra-specific analysis, the mitochondrial segments of the cox2-3
spacer, the plastidial rbcL-rbcS spacer, and the nuclear-encoded ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
are more efficient due to the higher rate of change (Zuccarello et al. 2006, Conklin et al. 2009, Zhao & He
2011, Tan et al. 2012, 2013, Halling et al. 2013).

The northeastern region of Brazil is a priority area for conservation worldwide due to the presence of
coral reefs. However, the demand for production of Kappaphycus alvarezii in Paraíba has superseded the need
for environmental monitoring actions and conservation. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the biological
and ecological aspects of this species to evaluate the environmental risks of its introduction into the tropical
region. The present study aimed to identify the lineage of K. alvarezii introduced into the northeastern coast of
Brazil using molecular markers, and comparing its sequences with others cultivated worldwide.

Materials and methods
Kappaphycus alvarezii samples were collected in October 2010 in Pitimbu beach, Paraíba, the tropical region
of Brazil (07° 30’ 10.5” S, 34°47’ 53.5” W) (Fig. 1), as floating seaweeds, which were produced by
cultivation in the same region. Nine drift individuals were collected along the beach near the raft cultivation:
three individuals of each pigment variant: red, green, and brown. The voucher specimens were deposited in
the Herbarium of the Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, Brazil (SP 400964).

FIGURE 1. Map showing Paraíba State, northeastern Brazilian coast and Kappaphycus alvarezii collection site (arrow).

Molecular analyses: DNA was extracted from approximately 40 mg of dried samples processed in the
Precellys homogenizer using the DNeasy @ Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, EUA). Polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was performed using the mitochondrial cox2-3 spacer. The primer sequence was the same as
that used by Zuccarello et al. (1999), and the products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.7% agarose to
confirm the product size. The PCR products were purified with MicroSpinTM S-300 HR columns (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, USA). Sequencing was performed with the BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, NJ, USA) on an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems). The primers used for sequencing were the same as the used for PCR amplification.
Phylogenetic analyses: all sequences were aligned using BioEdit 7.1.3.0 (Hall 1999) and deposited in the
NCBI Genbank, and Kappaphycus and Eucheuma sequences from other sites were selected for comparison
with the sequences from this study (Table 1).

Phylogenetic relationships were inferred with the Maximum likelihood (ML) method using MEGA 5.05
(Tamura et al. 2011). Gaps or missing data were treated as complete deletions, and bootstrap was performed
with 1,000 replicates. MrBayes v.3.0 beta 4 (Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001) was used to calculate the
Bayesian inference (BI). The evolution model was selected based on an ML ratio test with MEGA 5.05 using
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The evolution model used

was the general-time-reversible model of nucleotide substitution with invariant sites and gamma distributed
rates for variable sites (GTR+I+G) (Tamura et al. 2011). BI analysis was performed using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method, sampling one tree every 10 generations for 1,000,000 generations, starting with a
random tree. Betaphycus philippinensis M.S. Doty (1995: 237) was used as an outgroup sample.

Results
The final sequences including the cox2–3 spacer contained 398–399 nucleotides. The phylogenetic tree
topologies of the Maximum likelihood (ML) and the Bayesian inference (BI) methods were not identical;
however, in both analyses Kappaphycus and Eucheuma samples formed distinct clusters (Fig. 2).
The Kappaphycus samples were included in distinct clades with K. cottonii (A. Weber-van Bosse 1913:
115) M.S. Doty ex P.C. Silva in Silva et al. (1996: 333) from the Philippines the most distinct. Other samples
formed three main clades: K. alvarezii (A1 and A2), Kappaphycus spp. from Hawaii (B) and K. striatum (C),
with high support (ML = 99%) (Fig. 2).

The sequences of Kappaphycus alvarezii from northeastern Brazil grouped with those samples cultivated
in Hawaii, Venezuela, Tanzania and Malaysia, forming subclade A1 with moderate support (ML = 81%, BI =
0.91). The sequence from Zanzibar and Madagascar grouped as subclade A2 with moderate support (ML =
70%, BI = 0.98).
The Kappaphycus spp. from Hawaii formed distinct clade (B) with high support (ML = 99%, BI = 1.00),
confirming the phylogenetic relationship reported by Zuccarello et al. (2006) and Conklin et al. (2009).
Kappaphycus striatum was divided in two clades (C1 and C2) with high support (ML = 99%). The clade C1
included species from Indonesia, and clade C2 those from Malaysia and the Philippines.
Additionally, the species of Eucheuma were distributed into five clades, forming distinct groups according
to the species.

Discussion
Our results showed that the northeastern Brazilian specimens of Kappaphycus alvarezii is part of the
worldwide cultivated subclade A strain, as predicted by Zuccarello et al. (2006) and Conklin et al. (2009).
These strains have been considered having low invasion potential, since they are biologically limited because
they were not found to produce viable spores, while it could reproduce by vegetative fragmentation
(Zuccarello et al. 2006, Conklin et al. 2009). In southeast region of Brazil, Paula et al. (1999) observed
tetraspore production from K. alvarezii in laboratory experiments only once. Although tetraspores of K.
alvarezii germinated, they had low survival rates, suggesting that the strain studied is almost sterile (Bulboa &
Paula 2005, Bulboa et al. 2008). According to Paula et al. (1999) the high mortality of tetraspore progeny of
K. alvarezii cultivated in southeastern Brazil could be a consequence of their hybrid origin or clonal
propagation, which may cause a reduced reproductive potential and abortive spore formation.
Previous studies demonstrated that K. alvarezii has remote invasion potential in southern and southeastern
Brazil (Paula et al. 1999, 2002, Bulboa & Paula 2005, Bulboa et al. 2008, Castelar et al. 2009, Hayashi et al.
2011). Reproductive structures in cultivated K. alvarezii are rare (Doty 1985, Areces 1995, Castelar et al.
2009; Hayashi et al. 2011), and even the spores produced in the laboratory are not all viable (Bulboa et al.
2008). Moreover, in the field, the drift algae fragments are most likely affected by herbivory or are killed by
environmental factors such as temperature and water transparency (Bulboa & Paula 2005, Castelar et al. 2009,
Hayashi et al. 2011). However, these results are not applicable for northeastern Brazilian coast, which has
different environmental conditions, such as water temperature, transparency and nutrients (Castelar et al.
2009), as well as a reef formation. Therefore, further studies are desirable to evaluate the potential risk of
invasion according to local environmental conditions and to highlight the need for monitoring programs in
these regions.
Furthermore, our samples had a close relationship with those cultivated lineages from Hawaii, Venezuela,
Malaysia, and Tanzania (A1), suggesting the similarity of these strains. This information can support the
identification of the origin for K. alvarezii strains introduced and cultivated in northeastern Brazil. Moreover,
the accurate identification of this strain will help us to support the future management and monitoring
program, including ecological studies as well as improving the seaweed farming.
The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the subclades A1 and A2 corresponded to the cultivated species
of Kappaphycus (Zuccarello et al. 2006, Conklin et al. 2009, Zhao & He 2011, Halling et al. 2013, Tan et al.
2012, 2013) where our samples were assembled. The clade B was formed by a different Kappaphycus species.
Some authors dispute the identification inconsistency of this material; however, this clade represents a single
wild seaweed haplotype from Hawaii and expresses invasive characteristics only in Hawaii (Conklin & Smith
2005, Zuccarello et al. 2006, Conklin et al. 2009). Kappaphycus cottonii was shown to be a highly divergent
sister taxon to the all other Kappaphycus samples, and more studies are needed to investigate the taxonomy of
this species (Zuccarello et al. 2006, Tan et al. 2013).

The mitochondrial cox2-3 spacer was effective for the identification and comparison of our strain of K.
alvarezii with other available strains of this species as predicted in previous studies, which highlighted the
usefulness of this marker for the phylogenetic analysis of Kappaphycus and Eucheuma (Zuccarello et al.
1999, 2006, Conklin et al. 2009, Halling et al. 2013, Tan et al. 2012, 2013). This effectiveness is due to the
relatively short length of the sequences, contributing for simpler amplification and sequencing which provides
better resolution and more variation within the cox2-3 spacer region (Zuccarello et al. 1999, 2006, Conklin et
al. 2009, Tan et al. 2012). However, Tan et al. (2012) considered cox2-3 spacer to be more appropriate to
DNA barcode in these two genera. Zhao & He (2011) demonstrated the efficacy of the ITS marker to
determine inter- and intra-specific analyses, arguing that such a marker has more accurate molecular protocol
for the classification of eucheumatoid algae as compared to others, despite few Kappaphycus and Eucheuma
have been sequenced with ITS marker up to date.
This study represents the first investigation towards the knowledge on Kappaphycus alvarezii cultivated
in the northeastern Brazilian coast. The results obtained in the present study confirmed the identification and
similarity of the northeastern Brazilian strain with those cultivated worldwide, which have never shown
invasive behavior. However, more detailed investigations and use of environmental monitoring are
recommended before commercial cultivation of this species can be authorized in tropical region of Brazil
