Abstract
A new species of Thismia (Thismiaceae) from Borneo is described. Thismia hexagona was discovered in 2013 in
lowland mixed dipterocarp forest in Ulu Temburong, Brunei Darussalam. The species is circumscribed, illustrated and its
position within the Malesian species of the genus is characterised by insertion into the existing determination key. Its
most conspicuous feature is bright yellow, sharply hexagonal flower annulus.
Kew words: tropical rain forest, mycoheterotrophy, Malesia, Burmanniaceae

Introduction
The Family Thismiaceae (Dioscoreales) is a small group of achlorophyllous mycoheterotrophic herbaceous
plants, formerly treated as a tribe Thismieae in the family Burmanniaceae (Merckx et al. 2006). It contains
five genera: Afrothismia Schlechter (1907: 138), Haplothismia Airy Shaw (1952: 277), Oxygyne Schlechter
(1907: 140), Thismia Griffith (1844: 221) and Tiputinia Berry & Woodward in Woodward et al. (2007: 158).
Its distribution covers tropical and subtropical zones globally, with a few species extending to temperate
regions (Maas-van de Kamer 1998, Woodward et al. 2007).
The genus Thismia, comprising about 50 species, is the most widespread and species-rich genus of the
family Thismiaceae. It has a pantropical distribution, with two main centres of biodiversity: the Atlantic Rain
Forest of South America and Southeast Asia (Jonker 1948, Mancinelli et al. 2012). Members of the genus are
small herbs with reduced, scale-like leaves, actinomorphic or zygomorphic, urceolate to campanulate flowers.
Perianth lobes are six, free or three inner lobes connivent at the apex forming erect mitre with three holes
(Jonker 1948). After Jonker (1938), Southeast Asian species with mitre-like flowers are treated as section
Sarcosiphon (Blume) Jonker (1938: 251) while species with free perianth lobes as section Thismia. The latter
section is divided into two subsections: Odoardoa Schlechter (1921: 34) including species with all perianth
lobes that are equal in length and size, and Brunonithismia Jonker (1938: 242) including species with inner
perianth lobes that are larger than outer lobes.
Members of the genus Thismia are generally poorly-known, often collected only once or a few times.
They are easily overlooked in the field because of their small growth form and the ephemeral nature of their
aboveground parts (Larsen & Averyanov 2007). Many species are also likely extremely rare, with scattered
distributions. As a result of these factors, it is highly possible that undescribed species can still be found in
Southeast Asia (Larsen & Averyanov 2007, Chantanaorrapint 2012).

During our field work at Kuala Belalong Field Studies Centre (KBFSC) in the Temburong District of
Brunei Darussalam in February 2013, we found a species of Thismia clearly belonging to the sect. Thismia.
The section is represented by five species on the island of Borneo, but no species has been reported from
Brunei Darussalam until now (Jonker 1948, Coode et al. 1996, Jarvie 1996, Tsukaya & Okada 2005). In their
general appearance and coloration, the plants resembled Thismia bifida M. Hotta (1967: 161) from Sarawak,
but differed in several important morphological characters from other previously described species of the
genus. We therefore report this as a first record of the family for Brunei Darussalam and describe it here as a
new species for science.

Description
Thismia hexagona Dančák, Hroneš, Kobrlová & Sochor, sp. nov., Fig. 1
Thismia hexagona differs from congeneric species in having the following combination of morphological traits: all
perianth lobes equal, tapering into long filiform tentacles, stigmas bifid, yellow hexagonal annulus and four anther
appendages.
Type:—BRUNEI DARUSSALAM. Temburong Distr.: Kuala Belalong, eastern ridge of Sungai Belalong, near its
confluence with Sungai Temburong. Coordinates WGS 84: N 04° 32.952’; E 115° 09.792’, elevation ca. 320 m
a.s.l., 13 February 2013. M. Dančák, M. Hroneš, M. Sochor & L. Kobrlová 2013/17 (holotype BRUN [herbarium
specimen, accession number 23947], isotype OL [herbarium specimen, accession number 23093]).

Terrestrial, achlorophyllous, mycoheterotrophic herb. Roots thick, hardly branched, vermiform, creeping,
whitish. Stem erect, simple or poorly branched in upper part, brown, glabrous, 1.7–7.0 cm tall; stem branches
usually unequal in length. Leaves few, appressed, scale-like, narrowly triangular, ca. 4 mm long, ca. 2 mm
wide at the base, acute at the apex. Floral bracts one or two, similar in shape to the leaves, ca. 7 mm long, ca.
2.0 – 2.5 mm wide at the base. Flowers solitary at the top of each branch. Perianth actinomorphic with 6 tepals
fused into urceolate perianth tube with free, equal apical lobes; perianth tube ca. 1.0–1.5 cm long, pale
brownish with lower part usually white, with 12 faint brownish longitudinal streaks and brown-purple apical
stripe, widest at the upper quarter, at the apex with broad bright yellow, clearly hexagonal annulus (Fig. 1B);
inner surface of the perianth tube with 12 faint longitudinal ribs and densely covered with short horizontal
bars; perianth lobes brown-yellowish, equally triangular, abruptly ended with long filiform appendages 7–18
mm long, brown-yellowish at the base, white at the top. Stamens 6, borne on thickened margin of the perianth
tube; filaments curved downwards, connective broad, connate to form a tube, with two distinct teeth-like
appendages at the free apical margins and two thick cylindrical finger-shaped appendages positioned slightly
above the marginal ones (Fig. 1C, D, 2D). Stigma 3-lobed, lobes shortly bifid (Fig. 1E); ovary cup-shaped
usually with brown- purple stripe at the top. Fruit cup-shaped brown capsule. Seeds ellipsoid.
Habitat and ecology:—Thismia hexagona grows amongst leaf litter and on rotten logs in the lowland
mixed dipterocarp forest. It prefers humid places in gullies formed by small episodic streams (Fig. 3). A total
of 21 flowering individuals were found within the 1-ha permanent forest plot (Plot 1) belonging to Kuala
Belalong Field Studies Centre of Universiti Brunei Darussalam (Hédl et al. 2009).
Distribution:—Species is known only from the type locality: eastern ridge of Sungai Belalong, near its
confluence with Sungai Temburong. It is also the first record of the genus and family from Brunei Darussalam
(cf. Coode et al. 1996, J. A. Ahmad, pers. comm.).
Conservation status:—The studied population occurs within the designated research zone of Ulu
Temburong National Park, to which public access is restricted. The habitat, type locality and its surroundings
are thus protected from logging and similar destructive anthropogenic activities. However, it is impossible to
assess the current conservation status of this species because there is no information on its population size and
dynamics. Therefore, we suggest to evaluate the species as data deficient (DD) according to the IUCN Red
List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2012).

Etymology:—Named after the conspicuous shape of flower annulus.
Variability:—The population as a whole was uniform, with no considerable morphological variation.
Most of the individuals were one-flowered, only few two-flowered and one individual with three flowers.
Some variability was observed in the colour of the perianth tube. A typical individual had an almost white
lower part of the perianth tube, with the upper part brownish and a more or less conspicuous brown-purple
stripe at the top just beneath the annulus (Fig. 2A). We found two flowering shoots, probably originating from
the same root system with a yellow stripe instead of the brown-purple one (Fig. 2B), which we suggest is a
result of mutation. Few individuals had perianth tubes that were brownish throughout with almost no white
basal portion. Most of the plants also had a brown-purple stripe at the top of ovary, which made an impression
of two-purple-striped perianth tube.

Discussion
It is believed by several researchers that some members of the genus Thismia could be very rare (Stone 1980,
Larsen & Averyanov 2007, Chantanaorrapint 2012). However, some of these presumed rare species may
actually be neglected. The recent discoveries of Thismia alba Holttum ex Jonker (1948: 23) and T. clavigera
(Beccari) F. Mueller (1891: 235) from Thailand (Chantanaorrapint & Sridith 2007, Chantanaorrapint &
Chantanaorrapint 2009) indicate that these inconspicuous ephemeral plants tend to be overlooked or undercollected. Most Thismia species do seem to be extremely rare, usually collected only once. If this is a true
observation and not an artefact of collection effort, this rarity could be caused especially by a combination of

two mechanisms: (1) the tight bond of the plant with its host fungus and, (2) a specific mode of seed
dispersion. Merckx & Bidartondo (2008) discovered host-specific associations between members of a closely
related African genus Afrothismia and arbuscular fungi from the genus Glomus Tulasne & C. Tulasne (1845:
63). A similar pattern could also be expected in Thismia where the scarcity and limited distribution range of
its fungal host may lead to the rarity of plants in this genus. With respect to seed dispersal, Stone (1980)
suggested that seeds of Thismia are dispersed out of their capsules by rain-splash, thus implying that the seeds
are dispersed over very short distances. These hypotheses need further studies and additional observations to
be eventually accepted as plausible explanations for Thismia rarity.
From the morphological point of view, Thismia hexagona is clearly distinct from other Thismia species of
the Malesian region through a combination of following traits: 1. perianth lobes all equally sized, 2.
conspicuous hexagonal raised annulus, 3. bifid stigmas and 4. four anther appendages. Species that are
morphologically closest to Thismia hexagona are members of sect. Thismia subsect. Odoardoa with perianth
lobes triangular at the base and tapering into filiform appendages: Thismia bifida, T. lauriana Jarvie (1996:
259) and T. mullerensis Tsukaya & Okada (1995: 129) from Borneo, Thismia aseroe Beccari (1877: 252) from
Peninsular Malaysia and Thismia alba from Peninsular Malaysia and Thailand. Members of this
morphologically invariable group have a round annulus, thus the hexagonal annulus of T. hexagona is
unique within the group. Also, the number of anther appendages (four) differs from the other members of
subsect. Odoardoa varying from 1 (T. alba) to 3 (T. aseroe and T. bifida). As the shape and general appearance
of anthers provide useful characters for taxonomy of Thismia (Thiele & Jordan 2002), we consider the four
anther appendages in T. hexagona as an important diagnostic feature. Some species of the subsection could be
superficially similar to T. hexagona due to the pattern of their coloration (Thismia alba, T. aseroe and T.
bifida). However, they differ by some further morphological traits: Thismia alba and T. aseroe do not have
bifid stigmas and have small perianth appendages alternating the perianth lobes while T. bifida lacks
transverse bars throughout the perianth tube.
Similarly bright yellow, distinctly raised hexagonal annulus is also observed in Thismia javanica Smith
(1910: 32) from the Malesian region, Thailand and Vietnam and Thismia tentaculata Larsen & Averyanov
(2007: 16) from Vietnam and China. However, these two species clearly differ from T. hexagona, being
members of subsect. Brunonithismia, as the inner perianth lobes are larger than the outer lobes.
