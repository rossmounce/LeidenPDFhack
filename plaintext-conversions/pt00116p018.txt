Abstract
Mappia includes four species of trees and shrubs distributed in Central America, Mexico and the Greater Antilles.
Mappia has historically been associated with the genera Casimirella (=Humirianthera), Icacina, Leretia and
Nothapodytes, collectively comprising the Mappia complex, and over the years authors have merged or maintained these
genera based on various lines of morphological and anatomical evidence. Here we present a phylogenetic study of the
Mappia complex, based on morphological and molecular data, to assess monophyly of Mappia as well as relationships
among other icacinaceous genera. Our results indicate that Mappia is sister to the Asiatic genus Nothapodytes, consistent
with previous studies, and that Leretia, Icacina and Casimirella form a clade more closely related to other genera of
Icacinaceae (e.g., Alsodeiopsis, Iodes, Phytocrene) than to Mappia+Nothapodytes. These results support recognition of
Mappia as a distinct entity, and here we provide an updated taxonomic treatment for the genus, recognizing four species
including three from Mexico and Central America (M. longipes, M. mexicana, and M. multiflora) and one from the
Greater Antilles (M. racemosa).

Introduction
Mappia Jacquin (1797: 22) was forgotten until Miers (1852) assigned many new species mainly from Asia to
this genus. Mappia has historically been associated with the Neotropical genus Leretia Vellozo (1829: 99),
and both have been treated in different ways. Bentham (1862), Engler (1893), House (1922), Baehni (1936)
and Sleumer (1940, 1942) merged these genera. In contrast, Miers (1852), Engler (1893) and Howard (1942)
maintained both. Baehni (1936) segregated the Asiatic species of Mappia into a new genus, Neoleretia Baehni
(1936: 35) (= Nothapodytes Blume 1850: 248). Howard (1942) provided morphological evidence that these
genera are all distinct. More recently, Dahl (1952) provided palynological evidence supporting Leretia and
Mappia as distinct entities. House (1922) and Baehni (1936) mentioned that the name Mappia is illegitimate,
but the last author proposed to conserve the name, which was agreed in 1940.
Phylogenetic analyses based on morphological data (Kårehed 2001) indicated that Mappia and Leretia are
not closely related and that the Asiatic genus Nothapoytes is sister to Mappia, although these analyses did
place Mappia+Nothapodytes within a larger clade including Lavigeria Pierre (1892: 267), Leretia, Icacina
Jussieu (1823:174), Casimirella Hassler (1913: 249) and Pleurisanthes Baillon (1874: 201). However, several
of these genera (i.e., Casimirella, Lavigeria, Leretia and Pleurisanthes) have yet to be included in molecular
phylogenetic analyses, and consequently relationships among members of the Mappia complex (Mappia,
Nothapodytes, Leretia, Casimirella and Icacina) and other icacinaceous genera, especially Lavigeria,
Pleurisanthes, Iodes Blume (1825: 29) and Phytocrene Wallich (1831: 11), remain poorly known.

Here we present results of a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological and molecular (plastid ndhF)
data to address the following questions: (1) is Mappia monophyletic and with what other genera is it placed
within Icacinaceae, especially with respect to other genera of the Mappia complex (Casimirella, Icacina,
Leretia and Nothapodytes); and (2) which morphological characters are synapomorphic for Mappia? We also
provide an updated taxonomic treatment of Mappia, recognizing four species from Central America, Mexico
and the Greater Antilles. Based on this circumscription of Mappia, the genus can be recognized by the
following features: trees or shrubs, leaves without stipules, domatia in the abaxial surface of the leaves,
malphigiaceous hairs in vegetative and floral structures, inflorescence axillary, bracts and bracteoles absent,
flowers pentamerous, petals bearded on their inner surface and ovary surrounded by a disc.

Materials and Methods
Cartographic maps were produced on a DIVA-GIS base map (Hijmans et al. 2004) using ArcView 3.2 (ESRI
1999) by plotting locality data extracted from available herbarium specimens and relevant literature (Angulo
2006, Duno & Angulo 2010). This map was later edited with Adobe Photoshop 6.0.1 (Adobe Systems Inc,
San Jose, California).
Morphological matrix
Flowers from herbarium material were soaked in concentrated ammonium hydroxide for about one minute for
rehydration and then rinsed in water until soft and ready for study under a dissecting microscope. Flowers thus
pretreated were temporarily preserved in a 70:25:5 ethanol:water:glycerine solution for further study and later
returned to herbarium sheets. Characters states were obtained from hydrated flowers or direct observation
from herbarium material with a Nikon SMZ800 microscope. In the taxonomic treatment, numerical data
include the minimal and maximum values; mean and standard deviation are branches.
We used anatomical and pollen information from Karehed (2001); however, most characters turned out to
be uninformative in the context of the ingroup-outgroup relationships and therefore were not included in this
study. Terminology follows the Systematic Association Committee for descriptive biological terminology
(1962) for leaf shape and apex.
A morphological data matrix of 44 characters (Table 1) was produced after careful examination of more
than 100 herbarium specimens of Mappia and outgroup taxa from the following herbaria: AAU, BM, CICY, F,
G, GOET, HUH, K, MEXU, MO, NY, P, TX, US, XAL and VEN (acronyms according to Thiers 2010).
Specimens examined included types of all terminal taxa.
Phylogenetic analysis based on morphological data
In the phylogenetic analysis based only on morphology, two taxa were designated as outgroups based on
previous phylogenetic information (Kårehed 2001): Ottoschulzia pallida Lundell (1912: 272–273) and
Oecopetalum mexicanum Greenman & Thompson (1914[1915]: 408). Regarding the ingroup, four taxa of
Mappia were included based on previous data (Angulo 2006, Duno & Angulo 2010): M. longipes Lundell
(1942: 26), M. multiflora Lundell (1970: 139), M. mexicana Robinson & Greenmam (1895: 50) and M.
racemosa Jacquin (1797: 22); we also included other members of the Mappia group—Icacina senegalensis
Jussieu (1823: 174), Casimirella Hassler (1913: 249), Leretia cordata Vellozo (1829: 99), Nothapodytes
foetida (Wight, 1843–1845: 955) Sleumer (1940: 247)—as well as Lavigeria macrocarpa (Oliver 1866: 357)
Pierre (1892: 267) and Pleurisanthes howardii Duno, Riina & Berry (2002: 13), which formed a clade with
members of the Mappia group in previous analyses (Kårehed 2001).
Parsimony analyses of the morphological data set were conducted using PAUP* version 4.0 (Swofford
2003). The analyses included a heuristic search with characters equally weighted and unordered, 1000
replicates with random taxon sequence addition, tree bisection-reconnection branch swapping (TBR), with
multiple shortest trees kept during branch swapping, but with no more than 10 trees saved per replicate. We

pallida Lundell (1975: 105) and Ottoschulzia rhodoxylon Urban (1912: 274). The ingroup sampling includes
four representatives of Mappia, allowing us to assess monophyly. However, we were only able to sample three
of the four Mappia species recognized here for molecular data because the fourth species, M. longipes, is
based on a single specimen that was not available for DNA sampling. Our sampling also includes
representatives of all genera of the Mappia complex discussed in the introduction (Mappia, Leretia,
Nothapodytes, Casimirella [only morphological data] and Icacina), allowing us to determine relationships
among these and other icacinaceous genera. Because the phylogenetic position and circumscription of
Icacinaceae remain unresolved (Kårehed 2001), we included a broader sampling of lamiid taxa. Ilex crenata
Thunberg in Murray (1784: 168), a representative of the campanulid family Aquifoliaceae, was used as the
ultimate outgroup.
DNA was extracted from silica-gel dried (Chase & Hills 1991) or herbarium material using a modified
CTAB protocol (Doyle & Doyle 1987). We used the primers 972F and 2110R described by Olmstead &
Sweere (1994) to amplify the 3’ half of ndhF. The PCR reactions included 25 µl total (2.5 µl 10X buffer, 5.0
µ l Q solution (Qiagen), 1.0 µl MgCl2 (25mM), 1.0 µ l dNTPs (25mM), 1 µl each for the F and R primers
(10mM), 0.2 µl Taq polymerase, 1.0 ul DNA template, and 11.3 ul of ddH20), with the following conditions:
denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 49°C for
90 s, and extension at 72°C for 3 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. The same primers were
used for amplification and sequencing. The newly generated sequences were assembled and edited using
Sequencher 4.2.2. (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) and then aligned with additional ndhF
sequences from GenBank using Muscle (Edgar 2004), followed by manual adjustment in Se-Al (Rambaut
1996). The 5’ portions of the GenBank ndhF sequences were trimmed off to match the sequences generated
for this study.
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using maximum likelihood (ML) in RAxML (Stamatakis 2006)
and parsimony in PAUP* version 4.0 (Swofford 2003). The parsimony analyses included a heuristic search
with characters equally weighted and unordered, 1000 replicates with random taxon sequence addition, tree
bisection-reconnection branch swapping (TBR), with multiple shortest trees kept during branch swapping, but
with 10 trees saved per replicate. To assess clade support within a parsimony context, we conducted 10000
bootstrap replicates with random sequence addition, TBR, with 10 trees maximum saved per bootstrap
replicate. For the ML analyses in RAxML, the model GTRGAMMA was implemented in the ML searches
and bootstrap replicates. Thorough bootstrap and ML searches were conducted together, with bootstrap 1000
replicates. Gaps were treated as missing data in all analyses.
Combined molecular-morphological phylogenetic analyses
We also conducted combined molecular-morphological phylogenetic analyses, using parsimony in PAUP*
version 4.0 (Swofford 2003). For these analyses, we combined the available morphological data (for 12
species of Icacinaceae) with the ndhF sequences. For three taxa (Casimirella, Mappia longipes and
Pleurisanthes), we had only morphological data; the molecular characters for these taxa were therefore treated
as missing data. Additionally, for 23 other taxa (including other species of Icacinaceae and asterid outgroups)
we had available molecular data but no morphological data; thus the morphological characters for these taxa
were treated as missing data in the matrix. Multiple studies have shown that missing data are not necessarily
problematic in the context of combined molecular-morphological phylogenetic analyses (e.g., Wiens 2003,
2009); therefore, we think this analytical approach should yield reasonable results, and at the least an
interesting comparison with the separate morphological and molecular analyses.
For the combined analyses, as with the separate molecular and morphological parsimony analyses, we
conducted a heuristic search (including 1000 replicates with random taxon sequence addition, TBR branch
swapping, and multiple shortest trees kept during branch swapping, but with 10 trees saved per replicate) to
find the most-parsimonious tree(s) as well as 10,000 bootstrap replicates to assess clade support.

Results
In the morphological phylogenetic analysis, all 44 characters (Table 1) were informative, and analysis
produced a single most-parsimonious tree (Figure 1) with the following statistics: length (L) = 90, consistency
index (CI) = 0.61, and retention index (RI) = 0.72. Seven synapomorphies (characters 9, 23, 29, 34, 38, 39,
and 40) support the sister relationship of Nothapodytes and Mappia, and monophyly of Mappia is supported
by seven synapomorphies (characters 10, 11, 17, 22, 41, 42, 43). Within Mappia, M. racemosa was recovered
as sister to the rest of the genus, followed by M. mexicana sister to M. longipes + M. multiflora, although
several of these nodes received relatively weak support in the bootstrap analyses (Figure 1). Bootstrap
analysis of the morphological data recovered Mappia (bootstrap percentage, BP, 96) as sister (BP 95) to
Nothapodytes, but relationships within Mappia were unresolved. Icacina received moderate support (BP 80)
as sister to Mappia+Nothapodytes, but placements of the other ingroup taxa included (Leretia, Casimirella,
Lavigeria) were unresolved.

percentages are displayed for nodes that received at least 50.

In the molecular analyses, consistent relationships within Icacinaceae, or the Icacina group sensu Kårehed
(2001), were recovered regardless of the optimality criterion. In both ML (Fig. 2) and parsimony analyses,
Mappia was well supported (BP 98 for both) as sister (BP 100 for both) to Nothapodytes; this pair was sister
to all other members of the Icacina group. Leretia cordata formed a strongly supported clade with Icacina and
Lavigeria (ML BP or MBP 96, parsimony or PBP 92), with Alsodeiopsis Oliver in Bentham & Hooker (1867:
996) being moderately supported as sister to this group (MBP 76, PBP 75). This clade (including Icacina,
Lavigeria, Leretia, and Alsodeiopsis) received moderate support (MBP 75, PBP 75) as sister to the remaining
members of Icacinaceae, i.e., Iodes, Phytocrene, Stachyanthus Engler (1897: 227) and Pyrenacantha Wight in
Hooker (1830: 107). Within Mappia, M. mexicana received relatively weak support as sister to M. racemosa +
M. multiflora (MBP 72, PBP 61) in the bootstrap analyses; this same topology was recovered in the two
shortest trees inferred from the parsimony analysis.

FIGURE 2. The best tree (lnL -8160.768319) from the ML analysis in RAxML (GTR+G) including support from the bootstrap. Only
support of 50 percent and above is presented on the tree. The taxa previously included in the Mappia group are highlighted in blue.

In the combined molecular-morphological analyses, relationships recovered were generally similar to
those inferred in the molecular analyses (Figure 3). Four most-parsimonious trees were recovered (1492
steps), differing only in the relationships within Mappia. In the four shortest trees recovered, Casimirella,
Leretia, Pleurisanthes, Lavigeria, Icacina and Alsodeiopsis form a clade sister to Pyrenacantha,
Stachyanthus, Phytocrene and Iodes, with Mappia+Nothapodytes sister to these two groups. In the bootstrap
analysis of the combined data, relationships within Icacinaceae were largely unresolved, although Mappia
received strong support as monophyletic (BP 98) and sister to Nothapodytes (BP 99), and within Mappia, M.
longipes and M. multiflora were weakly supported as sister (BP 56).

included in the Mappia complex are highlighted in blue.

Discussion
Phylogenetic analyses based on morphological and molecular data indicate that Mappia is sister to the Asiatic
genus Nothapodytes (Figs. 1, 2, 3), providing an example of a disjunction between the Neotropics and
Southeast Asia. Given the abundant fossil record of Icacinaceae in Europe (Reid & Chandler 1933, Collinson
et al. 2012) and North America (Manchester 1994, Pigg et al. 2008, Rankin et al. 2008, Stull et al. 2011,
2012), this disjunction may reflect a broader historical distribution across Laurasia, perhaps during warmer
periods during the Paleogene. Within Mappia, there is morphological support (Figure 1) for a continental
clade (M. longipes, M. mexicana and M. multiflora) sister to the Antillean species M. racemosa; however,
these relationships were not well resolved in the molecular analyses or in the combined molecularmorphological analyses. Seven morphological synapomorphies support monophyly of Mappia, but only one
is considered relevant as a diagnostic for the genus: pollen with echinate ornamentation. However, this is also
present in some other genera not included in morphological analysis (Dahl 1952), e.g., Discophora Miers
(1852: 118), Desmostachys Miers (1852: 398) and Phytocrene. The floral disk is useful regionally for
recognizing Mappia, but this character is also found in the African genus Icacina and the Asiatic genus
Nothapodytes.

Although Leretia cordata has historically been associated with Mappia, with some authors even
considering these a single genus, the molecular analyses clearly indicate that they are not exclusively related.
Leretia appears to form a clade with Casimirella, Pleurisanthes, Lavigeria and Icacina, which is more closely
related to other icacinaceous genera (e.g., Alsodeiopsis, Iodes, and Phytocrene) than to the
Mappia+Nothapodytes clade. Collectively, the molecular and morphological data provide strong support for
the recognition of Mappia as distinct. The molecular data do not, however, provide sufficient support/
resolution within Mappia to discuss infrageneric relationships. A more extensive sampling of molecular data
for the species of Mappia will be necessary to better understand the genus.

Diagnostic features:—Mappia longipes is similar to M. multiflora but with a long peduncle up to 9 cm
long (vs. 3 cm). The phylogenetic analysis based on morphology shows M. longipes to be sister to M.
mexicana plus M. multiflora. The species is only known from the type specimen, and morphological variation

of inflorescences therefore cannot be evaluated. Additional collections of Mappia in Chiapas will be
necessary to determine if M. longipes is a distinct species or instead conspecific with M. multiflora.
Distribution and ecology:—Only known from the type locality in Mexico (Chiapas); it grows in forests
at 1300 m.
Conservation Status:—DD; there is inadequate information to make a direct, or indirect, assessment of
its risk of extinction based on its distribution and/or population status.
Common Names:⎯unknown. No uses reported.

Diagnostic features:—Mappia mexicana is the most remarkable species of genus with small obovate
leaves and petals lacking the typical beard inside. In the phylogenetic analysis based on morphology, this
species is placed in the continental clade with M. longipes and M. multiflora.
Distribution and ecology:—Mappia mexicana is endemic to the Gulf slope of Mexico, in a small area
between the borders of the states of San Luis Potosi and Tamaulipas. It grows in deciduous forest in
calcareous soil from 100–600 m.
Conservation Status:—EN. Mappia mexicana meets the criterion B1ab of the IUCN. The area occupied
by M. mexicana is less than 5.000 km2, and it is only known from three localities including some historical
collections in the city of Tampico. The habitat of the species is highly fragmented under natural conditions
and is also severely threatened by anthropogenic activities. None of the known populations resides in an area
under any level of protection.

Diagnostic features:—Mappia multiflora is similar to M. longipes but with a shorter peduncle up to 3 cm
long (vs. 9 cm). Its leaves are also longer than those of M. racemosa. The morphological analysis also shows
M. mutiflora as sister to M. longipes plus M. mexicana. It was considered informally as synonymous with M.
racemosa, but Angulo et al. (in press) proposed to keep both as distinct species based on morphology and
niche modeling.

Nomenclatural notes:—The infraspecific taxa have been treated as varieties or subspecies (Baehni 1936,
Howard 1942, Liogier 1953, Borhidi 1983). Howard (1942) mentioned some characters for each subspecific
taxon, but they do not consistently exhibit them. The most important difference, fruit with a fleshy mesocarp
or not, also occurs in Central America in specimens from the same localities (Los Tuxtlas Biological station),
and therefore the difference is probably due to variation in maturity of the fruit. The Flora of Cuba did not
recognize both varieties (Duno & Angulo 2010), and some nomenclatural clarification was carried out by
Duno et al. (2007).
Diagnostic features:—See comments under M. multiflora.
Distribution and ecology:—Mappia racemosa grows in the Greater Antilles in evergreen and deciduous
forest in calcareous soil at 0–1100 m. It flowers and fruits continuously.
Conservation Status:—LC. Mappia mexicana is found in the Greater Antilles scattered over a large area,
including some areas that are protected. It is therefore listed as least concern (LC) according to IUCN Red List
criteria (IUCN 2001).
Common Names:—Palo de caña (Bisse 1988). No uses reported.
