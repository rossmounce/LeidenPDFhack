Abstract
In this paper we describe and illustrate Clusia nitida, a new species from the Amazon with resin-producing flowers,
similar to C. microstemon and C. myriandra.

Introduction
Clusia Linnaeus (1753: 510) (Clusiaceae s.s., tribe Clusieae) has about 300 exclusively neotropical species.
Due to the poor knowledge of the Amazonian flora (Hopkins 2007, Schulman et al. 2007), the actual number
may be much higher. Many species still not described also occur in the Andes (M. Gustafsson, pers. comm).
For Brazil so far 67 species are listed (Bittrich 2013), but several undescribed species exist, for which only
one of the sexes is known, impeding their formal description (pers. obs.).
Clusias are trees, shrubs and hemi-epiphytes, usually dioecious, with the leaves more or less fleshy, and
showy flowers, offering various types of rewards, including floral resin. The ovary locules have (1–)2 to many
ovules. The fruits are septifragal fleshy capsules with usually two or more seeds per locule, the seeds are more
or less completely covered by a non-vascularized aril. Due to the great variability of the male androecium, the
species are generally much easier to recognize with male than with female flowers or with fruits. Therefore,
the infrageneric classification of the genus, mostly confirmed as natural by modern data, was based especially
on the morphology of the male androecium (Planchon & Triana 1860).
In this paper we describe a new species of Clusia for the Amazon, apparently belonging to the section
Phloianthera Planchon & Triana (1860: 319). Molecular data are still needed to confirm this placement, as
there is some confusion in the literature concerning the delimitation of sections Phloianthera and
Cordylandra Planchon & Triana (1860: 319). Sect. Cordylandra was even synonymized under sect.
Phloianthera by Pipoly et al. (1998), but molecular data (Gustafsson et al. 2007) clearly indicates that these
sections are not closely related. The new species here described belongs to a group of species with a flat disklike androecium in the staminate flowers, covered by a resin-pollen mixture, as occurs in Clusia renggerioides
Planchon & Triana (1860: 350) and other species of sect. Cordylandra. None of these species supposedly
belonging into sect. Phloianthera was hitherto included in a molecular phylogenetic study.

Taxonomy
Clusia nitida Bittrich & F. N. Cabral, sp. nov. (sect. Phloianthera) (Fig. 1 & Fig. 2)
Diagnosis: Similar to Clusia microstemon, but dry leaves are darker coloured and generally have a shiny surface, the
latex channels are denser on the adaxial surface, the midrib is conspicuous as far as to the apex, the petal colour is

different and anthers are absent on the lateral part of the disk-like androecium. The new species is also similar to
Clusia myriandra from which it differs by the leaf shape, the visibility of the latex channels on the leaves, the shorter
peduncle and basal internodes in the inflorescence, the size of the fruits and the lesser number of seeds.

attenuate, margin revolute; midrib prominent on the adaxial surface and conspicuous as far as the apex,
secondary veins prominent on both surfaces, with (9–)12–26(–29) pairs, 1.5–4.0 mm distant from each other
and at an angle of 35º–40º with the midrib, basal veins inconspicuous; latex canals concolorous on the adaxial
surface or slightly darker than the blade, immersed, 0.3–0.7 mm distant from each other, flat to protruding on
the abaxial surface, 0.8–1.0 mm distant from each other, forming an angle of about 25º with the midrib.
Inflorescence cymose, compact, 3–9-flowered (staminate plants) or 3–7-flowered (pistillate plants), bracts
and bracteoles united at the base, hemiorbicular, ca. 2 mm long, pedicels very short, ca. 2 mm long,
quadrangular. Epicalyx bracts 2 (+2), united at base, sepals 4 (2+2), rarely 5 or 6 (2+3, 3+3), ± suborbicular,
ca. 4–8 mm long and 4–8 mm wide. Petals 5–8, 6–13 x 6–12 mm, dark bordeaux or blood-red. Staminate
flower with the androecium forming a thick, circular, flat disk, ca. 3–6 mm wide, composed of about 300
densely compact stamens, the upper surface covered by a mixture of resin and pollen during anthesis,
filaments 2.3–3.0 mm long, lateral region of the disk without anthers, anther dehiscence by apical or
transverse slits. Pistillate flower with 3 or 4 series of staminodes around the base of the ovary, secreting resin
at the apex; staminodes linear, 1.3–2.0 mm long, truncated at the apex, without sterile anthers; stigmas 4 or 5,

Comparison:—The most similar species is C. microstemon Planchon & Triana (1860: 331), which
sometimes occurs sympatrically, and with which C. nitida has been confused. It has a wide distribution in the
Amazon. The main difference between the species is the male androecium, which in C. microstemon has
anthers at the lateral side of the androecial disk, whereas C. nitida has anthers only on its top. Other
differences include the darker colour and the glossy appearance of the leaf surfaces in sicco in C. nitida; the
androecium size, which is larger in C. microstemon; the flower colour, in C. microstemon the petals are
reddish to pinkish-purple in the centre and white-pink on the edge and the calyx is white-pink, while in C.
nitida the petals are dark bordeaux or blood-red and the calyx is green; C. microstemon has 4 or 5 ovules per
locule, whereas C. nitida has only 1 or 2(–3) ovules per locule; the fruits of C. microstemon are slightly ovoid
and in C. nitida they are generally cylindrical, and finally, C. microstemon has a lower density of latex
channels on the leaves than in C. nitida and the midrib becomes invisible in the apical part of the leaves.
Another similar species is C. myriandra (Bentham 1843: 368) Planchon & Triana (1860: 332) from the
Guianas, which has a very similar androecium. However, C. myriandra has elongated and oblanceolate
leaves, unlike C. nitida, which has shorter and more rounded broader leaves; the latex channels of the leaves,
which are easily visible in C. nitida, are invisible in the strongly coriaceous leaves of C. myriandra; the
peduncle and the basal internodes in the inflorescence are much longer in C. myriandra, positioning the
inflorescence above the foliage and C. myriandra has more elongated and larger fruits than C. nitida with 10
or more seeds per locule, while the fruit locules of C. nitida have only 1 or 2(–3).
Etymology:—Latin nitidus = shiny, because the dried leaves generally have a conspicuously shiny
surface, different from those of C. microstemon, the leaf surface of which is typically dull.
Distribution and habitat:—In Brazil, Clusia nitida is known from the North Region, in the states of
Amazonas and Roraima. Apparently, it has not yet been collected outside of Brazil. It mainly occurs in whitesand vegetation and at river margins in Amazonian lowlands.

Probably also R.L. Fróes 25319, Rio Urubú, Peixe Boi, 02°05' S, 60°05' W, 20 September 1949 (IAN!)
belongs to Clusia nitida, but the androecium of this specimen is hemispherically bulged similar as in Clusia
hilariana Schlechtendal (1833: 181).
