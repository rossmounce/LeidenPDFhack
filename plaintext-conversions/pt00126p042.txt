Abstract
Curcuma leonidii, a new species of Curcuma subg. Hitcheniopsis (Zingiberaceae) from southern Vietnam is described
and illustrated here. Curcuma leonidii with flowers similar to some Stahlianthus-like species but inflorescences
consisting of up to 8 green bracts and their arrangements conforming to usual ‘classical’ Curcuma-like species provides
the much-awaited morphological link between the two genera, of which Stahlianthus have been, based on molecular
results, recently proposed to be merged with Curcuma subg. Hitcheniopsis.
Key words: Bù Gia Mập National Park, Curcuma subgenus Hitcheniopsis, Stahlianthus

Introduction
Numerous ginger novelties, have recently been described (Dhetchuvi et al. 2011, Kumar et al. 2013),
including a new genus (Leong-Škorničková et al. 2011) and numerous species from Indochina (e.g. LeongŠkorničková et al. 2010, 2011, Lý et al. 2010, Nguyen & Leong-Škorničková 2012). As extensive
explorations of Zingiberaceae for the Flora of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam continue, numerous interesting
ginger species have been collected, including the new Curcuma L. (1753) which we describe and illustrate
below. It belongs to subgenus Hitcheniopsis Schuman (1904), because it lacks epigynous glands and anther
spurs (Záveská et al. 2012).
This new species of Curcuma was first discovered in southern Vietnam in 2005, during the expedition by
Prof. Leonid Averyanov & his collaborators to Bình Phước Province, Bù Gia Mập National Park (HLF 5062,
then identified as Kaempferia angustifolia Roscoe (1807)). The images of this collection have been confirmed
to represent a new species by the first author who is revising Curcuma for the Flora of Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam. With no spirit or living flowering material at hand, the description of this new species was not
pursued originally. The recent collections made by the second author were accompanied by material on spirit
and photographs of flower dissections, which now allows us to formally describe this species.
Description based on living material Lưu Hồng Trương, Đinh Nhật Lâm & Võ Huy Sang LUU 807 &
spirit material Lưu Hồng Trương, Đinh Nhật Lâm & Võ Huy Sang LUU 897 & LUU 898. Measurements
derived from dried material are explicitly mentioned. Terminology follows Beentje (2012).

Taxonomy
Curcuma leonidii Škorničk. & Lưu
Similar to Curcuma harmandii Gagnep. (subg. Hitcheniopsis) in inflorescence consisting of green bracts with no obvious
coma, but differs from it by having a more compact inflorescence (vs. more elongated in C. harmandii), white
corolla lobes (vs. greenish), white oblanceolate-spathulate shape of the lateral staminodes (vs. greenish-white nearly
linear) and white labellum with rich yellow well-defined median, the sides of the basal half of the median
puberulent, patched with red, and nearly plain margin (vs. white labellum with yellow pubescent median bordered
around with pink tinge, especially towards the apex, and crisped margin).

mature; described from a spirit material) obovoid, 1 × 7 mm, with persistent calyx, ca 11 seeds, seeds ovoid,
4–5 × 2 mm, mid-brown, glabrous, with laciniate arils (translucent white?).
Etymology:—We dedicate this small but beautiful species to Prof. Leonid V. Averyanov, who first
brought this species to our attention. Prof. Averyanov made exemplary contributions to the knowledge of
Vietnamese Orchidaceae. With his main Vietnamese collaborators, Prof. Phan Kế Lộc and Dr. Nguyễn Tiến
Hiệp, he also conducted multiple expeditions during past 20 years leading to great enhancement of general
floristic and phytogeographic knowledge of Vietnam and adjacent areas of eastern Indochina (e.g. Averyanov
et al. 2003).
Distribution & IUCN preliminary assessment:—So far known only from several sites in Bù Gia Mập
National Park, southern Vietnam. As this species has been reported so far only from less than five locations in
Bù Gia Mập National Park (c. 260 km2 surrounded by a buffer zone of increasingly more populated areas and
agricultural plantations), this species should be considered for the placement in the Endangered category, EN
B1ab (i, ii).
Ecology and phenology:—The species is typically found in understory of lowland, broadleaved,
evergreen forest, usually near streams, at around 350–400 m elevation. Flowering occurs between April to
May, fruiting around July.

Discussion
Recent molecular phylogeny of the genus Curcuma (Záveská et al. 2012) confirmed position of the genus
Stahlianthus Kuntze (1891) within the genus Curcuma and most of the members of this genus are now being
formally transferred (Leong-Škorničková et al., in prep.). Curcuma leonidii is an interesting find as it
morphologically bridges the gap between Stahlianthus-like species characterised by inflorescence composed
of two (or rarely three) fertile bracts and the ‘classical’ Curcuma-like species with few to many bracts per
inflorescence. Flowers of C. leonidii are similar to those of other Stahlianthus species (Fig. 2 C, D), but the
inflorescence with up to 8 green bracts and their arrangements conform to usual Curcuma species.
Morphologically the closest species outside the Stahlianthus alliance is Curcuma harmandii Gagnep. (1907)
(Fig. 2 A, B) that shares the character of an inflorescence composed of entirely green fertile bracts with no
coma and similarly coloured flowers.

Due to general similarity in shape of the inflorescence it is possible to mistake herbarium material of
Curcuma leonidii with some species of subgenus Ecomata Škorničk. & Šída f. (in Záveská et al. 2012). The
dissection of flowering material to confirm absence of epigynous glands is necessary, but rarely possible in
dried material due to the generally poor state of flowers. This example, yet again, underscore the paramount
importance of working with living flowering material, proper collection techniques including spirit
collections and detailed field character documentation, including colour photographs, in order to make a
progress in revising the family in Indochina and elsewhere.
The first collection was made by Averyanov et al. at Bù Gia Mập National Park (HLF 5062 as Kaempferia
angustifolia), of which we only saw a picture, because the specimen was unable to locate at HN and was not
present in the database at MO, and L. Averyanov confirmed it not to be present at LE (pers. comm.). The
second observation of this species was at the same National Park by the second author (LHT) in 2007, with
three subsequent collections he and his team made in 2012. The type collection from Đắc Ca stream was made
from a single population on 8 May 2012 by Lưu Hồng Trương, Đinh Nhật Lâm & Võ Huy Sang. Each plant
was attached to a unique collection number: LUU 807, 808, 809). The specimen with number LUU 807 was
selected to be a holotype, because it has well-preserved inflorescence, and the remaining two specimens from
this gathering, despite having different collection numbers, are thus to be treated as isotypes (ICN Arts 8.3.,
9.4., McNeill et al. 2012). The other two collections were made by the same team from the same location, one
on 7 May 2012 (collection numbers LUU 799, 800 & 801) and on 28 July 2012 (LUU 897 to 901). One more
collection, LUU 814, was made near Lưu Ly Waterfall, which lies about 1 km from Đắc Ca Stream. These as
well as HLF 5062 (currently unlocated) are hereby designated as paratypes.
