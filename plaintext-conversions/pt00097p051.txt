Abstract
Recent molecular phylogenies of the Lepidoziaceae indicate that the current classification is incongruent with
the phylogeny. Although substantial uncertainties remain, an interim classification is needed. The
classification proposed includes a broader definition of the Lembidioideae, reinstatement of Neolepidozia and
Tricholepidozia and the recognition of the new genus Ceramanus. While the Zoopsidoideae are unlikely to
represent a monophyletic group, it is not yet possible to provide a phylogenetically accurate revision of this
subfamily.

Introduction
The Lepidoziaceae are a species-rich cosmopolitan family of leafy liverworts. Although estimates of total
species number for liverworts are notoriously variable (von Konrat et al. 2010), the number of accepted
species is c. 860 (ELPT database), perhaps as much as 9–10% of the total liverwort species diversity.
Taxonomic diversity is highest in cool, wet areas of post-gondwanan land fragments, but the family is
cosmopolitan in distribution. In addition to being species-rich and exceptionally widespread, the family also
encompasses a large portion of the total morphological range covered by the liverworts. As well as the typical
leafy morphology of the type genus, Lepidozia, the family accommodates such disparate morphotypes as, for
example, Pteropsiella, which is remarkably similar to the simple thalloid morphology of the Metzgeriales, and
Protocephalozia, which resembles a charophycean alga with its branched filamentous protonema giving rise
directly to the gynoecial and androecial branches. Unsurprisingly, the Lepidoziaceae have presented a serious
challenge to students of liverwort classification.
Since the advent of molecular phylogenetics, liverwort classification has been changing rapidly (CrandallStotler & Stotler 2000, Crandall-Stotler et al. 2009, Vilnet et al. 2009). Molecular phylogenetics provides a
means of deriving robust hypotheses of relationship where ambiguous morphological characters, convergent
and parallel morphological evolution, and overall structural simplicity combine to make estimating phylogeny
from morphology difficult if not impossible (Renner et al. 2011). The value of morphological phylogenetics,
be it speculative or intuitive (e.g. Evans 1939, Fulford 1965, Schuster 1972, 1984a) or be it explicitly
analytical (e.g. Engel & Smith Merrill 2004, Renner et al. 2006), in providing an informative and useful set of
hypotheses is beyond doubt, but a truly phylogenetic classification of liverworts can only be achieved by
making use of molecular phylogenies. However, the rate at which novel molecular phylogenetic hypotheses
are appearing is currently faster than the rate at which novel classifications are being proposed. This is
presumably a result of the widely held belief in biological systematics that classifications, which are simply an
aid to communication, derive their utility in part from their information content and in part through stability.
In some cases, however, an emphasis on stability might be counter-productive in encouraging systematists to

publish only those classifications they consider final, where, in fact, the lack of an interim classification
provides a greater taxonomic impediment and leads to less stability overall. The Lepidoziaceae are one such
case, where an attempt to embody a literal reading of recent molecular phylogenies in a revised classification
is impossible, but where molecular phylogenetics clearly indicates that the current classification is wholly
inadequate.
The taxonomic history of the family begins in 1831 when Dumortier placed most of the, then known,
species belonging to the Lepidoziaceae into his Tribe Jungermanniaceae under the genus Pleuroschisma sect.
Lepidozia and sect. Pleuroschismotypus (Dumortier 1831). A few years later he erected the tribe
Pleuroschismeae and elevated sect. Lepidozia (Lepidozia with 8 species) and sect. Pleuroschismotypus
(Pleuroschisma with 9 species) to generic status (Dumortier 1835). A broader treatment of liverworts was
given by Gottsche, Lindenberg and Nees in their pioneering work Synopsis Hepaticarum (Gottsche et al.
1844-1847). They divided the Hepaticae (=Marchantiophyta) into tribes Jungermannieae (approximately
corresponding to the leafy and simple thalloid liverworts), Monocleae, Marchantieae, Riccieae (thalloid
groups) and Anthoceroteae (the hornworts). The Jungermannieae were subdivided into hemicyclum Foliosae
(leafy) and hemicyclum Frondosae (simple thalloid). In the Foliosae they treated three genera currently
assigned to the Lepidoziaceae, Lepidozia (38 species), Mastigobryum (=Bazzania, 54 species) and
Micropterygium (2 species) under subtribus Trichomanoideae along with Calypogeia and Physiotium
(=Pleurozia). These later two genera did not contain species currently placed in the Lepidoziaceae. A third
genus now assigned to Lepidoziaceae, Zoopsis (one species), was included in the Frondosae. The family itself
dates to 1877 when Limpricht, in Cohn’s Kryptogamen-Flora von Schlesien, treated Lepidozia under the
family Lepidozieae (=Lepidoziaceae) (Limpricht 1877). However, Stephani (1905-1909) who added greatly
to the number of described species, did not use family level divisions.
Reviving family concepts, Evans (1939) provided a classification of liverworts that was based on intuitive
phylogeny. The Lepidoziaceae included Bazzania, Lepidozia, Microlepidozia (=Kurzia), Acromastigum,
Micropterygium, Mytilopsis, Sprucella, Psiloclada, Mastigopelma and Telaranea, whilst Zoopsis,
Arachniopsis, Lembidium and Pteropsiella were placed in the Cephaloziaceae. Following Evans, Fulford
(1965) also provided an explication of her intuitive phylogeny. Her treatment of the leafy hepaticae of Latin
America (and associated work) included a review of the Lepidoziaceae in which the genera were assigned to
five families (Fulford 1962, 1963a, b, 1966, 1968; Fulford and Taylor 1959a, b, 1961). Lepidoziaceae was
comprised of 14 genera (Bazzania, Acromastigum, Paracromastigum, Bonneria, Lepidozia, Sprucella,
Neolepidozia, Micrisophylla, Microlepidozia, Telaranea, Psiloclada, Lembidium, Micropterygium and
Mytilopsis), the Regredicaulaceae with three genera (Regredicaulis, Arachniopsis and Odontoseries), the
Zoopsidaceae with two genera (Zoopsis and Pteropsiella), the Hyalolepidoziaceae with one genus
(Hyalolepidozia) and the Paracromastigaceae with two genera (Paracromastigum and Leucosarmentum).
The current classification of the family is largely based on the work of Rudolf Schuster who continued the
tradition of using intuitive phylogenetic relationships to form classifications (for a statement of Schuster's
phylogenetic system see Schuster 1972, 1984a). Schuster (1969a) dismissed Fulford's multifamily
classification in a footnote and circumscribed the broad family we know today. Molecular phylogenies have
universally supported Schuster’s circumscription of the family (Heslewood & Brown 2007, He-Nygrén et al.
2006, Hendry et al. 2007, Cooper et al. 2011, 2012), but Schuster himself recognised the substantial challenge
presented by subfamilial classification:
“…trying to find some way of splitting this large and admittedly complex family into two or more
separate, natural units, I am convinced that any such attempt must fail.” [Schuster, 1972]
Had he anticipated the profound influence that chain terminating DNA sequencing (Sanger et al. 1977) would
have in systematics, he would perhaps have been a little less pessimistic. The extent to which recent
phylogenies are incongruent with the existing classification means that substantial changes to the
classification will be required. Elsewhere I have expressed the opinion that changes to the classification would

be premature on the basis of the current phylogenetic data (Cooper et al. 2011, Cooper et al. 2012). Whilst this
is certainly true for parts of the family, several lineages have sufficient support in the molecular phylogenies
for changes to the classification to be proposed. In the interests of facilitating further phylogenetic, floristic
and taxonomic study of the family, the present contribution aims to provide a workable, interim classification
of the Lepidoziaceae. In doing so I emphasise that resolving the phylogeny of the Lepidoziaceae is a work in
progress and that future changes to this classification are inevitable.

The classification
The phylogeny of the Lepidoziaceae is summarised in figure 1 and a revised classification is proposed below.
The Early Land Plants Today project has identified a range of nomenclatural changes and these changes as
well as the outstanding combinations required by the classification proposed below are made in an
accompanying paper (Cooper et al. 2013). A global checklist of liverworts is in preparation (von Konrat,
Söderström and Hagborg pers. comm.) and will include a complete checklist of Lepidoziaceae arranged
according to the classification below.

FIGURE 1. Summary of phylogenetic relationships in the Lepidoziaceae. Only those groups strongly supported by molecular
phylogenetic analyses are shown (Cooper et al. 2011, 2012) and all other relationships are collapsed to polytomies. Taxa that have not
yet been included in a molecular phylogenetic study are indicated by dotted lines. Only Mastigopelma can be inserted in the phylogeny
with any confidence. Thick grey bars indicate those groups whose representatives in the molecular phylogeny did not form supported
monophyletic groups. Boxes are drawn around groups recognised in the interim classification. The uncertain status of Arachniopsis is
indicated by placing it in parentheses alongside Telaranea. Telaranea and Arachniopsis have been considered synonyms, with
Telaranea the conserved name (Engel & Smith Merrill 2002), but the types have not been included in phylogenetic analyses and it is
unclear whether one or more genera will be necessary to accommodate the species here retained in Telaranea.

Discussion
Several lineages within the Lepidoziaceae are resolved with a high degree of confidence. The Bazzanioideae,
a rare exception amongst Schuster’s subfamilies, is a monophyletic group whose membership requires no
revision in a phylogenetically accurate classification. Bazzania and Acromastigum are both well supported
monophyletic genera. Only the status of Mastigopelma remains in doubt. Although it seems likely that the
four species represent a group of diminutive Bazzania species that have lost the capacity to form terminal
branches, there is currently no molecular support for any taxonomic change. Unlike the Bazzanioideae,
phylogenetic study of the Lepidozioideae indicated that re-circumscription of this subfamily and its
constituent genera was required (Cooper et al. 2012). These changes are reflected in the classification
proposed here, in which the subfamily comprises four genera whose boundaries are supported by the
phylogeny. Based on strong phylogenetic support, the circumscription of the Lembidioideae is here expanded
to include Kurzia (previously included in the Lepidozioideae) and Pseudocephalozia (previously included in
the Zoopsidoideae). The Megalembidioideae has already been placed in synonymy with the Lembidioideae
(Cooper et al. 2011). The delimitation of genera in this subfamily requires additional study. Kurzia, a
widespread and morphologically varied genus, was not recovered as a monophyletic group and a broader,
more geographically representative, sampling will be required. The lembidioid clade, in addition to the more
speciose Hygrolembidium, comprises a diverse group of several monotypic or diatypic genera. The paraphyly
of Lembidium, here expanded to include L. berggrenii (previously a Chloranthelia), suggests that generic
delimitation should be revisited in the group.
The proposed classification leaves the Zoopsidoideae largely unchanged. The subfamily is unlikely to
represent a monophyletic group, but the depth of taxon sampling and the lack of resolution at the base of the
phylogeny leaves a phylogenetic revision of the subfamily impossible at this time. Nevertheless, the
phylogenetic relationships between several taxa provide interesting insights into morphological evolution in
the Lepidoziaceae. For example, the leaf apical cells in Telaranea major (Herzog 1950) Engel & Smith
Merrill (2004) are rounded and near isometric and the septa between the apical and penultimate cells is
constricted. In Zoopsidella caledonica (Stephani 1922) Schuster (1969b) and Z. ceratophylla (Spruce 1882)
Schuster (1969c) all cells of the lobes have this morphology and fragmentation of the lobes is believed to
provide a mechanism for asexual reproduction. Although this has not been reported in Telaranea major, the
close phylogenetic relationship between these species suggests that the unusual apical cell morphology is
derived from a homologous reproductive strategy in this clade. Similarly, the narrow lobe apical cells in
Psiloclada are perpendicular to the leaf disc and oriented towards the shoot apex. This character is shared with
those species of Zoopsis that are resolved with Psiloclada on the molecular phylogeny (Cooper et al. 2011). It
is likely that molecular phylogenetic analysis with dense taxon sampling and careful morphological study, in
particular study of leaf ontogeny, will yield well supported clades whose morphological evolution supports
revised subfamilial and generic groupings.
Several taxa are yet to be included in the molecular phylogeny; at the subfamily level Micropterygioideae
and Protocephalozioideae, and at the generic level Odontoseries, Pteropsiella, Meinungeria and
Mastigopelma. This group of unsampled taxa includes some of the more enigmatic elements of the
Lepidoziaceae; Meinungeria is unusual in having a largely echlorophyllose stem and greatly reduced leaves,
Pteropsiella has an extraordinarily broad, winged stem and retains only tiny vestigial leaves, and
Protocephalozia shows extreme neoteny of the gametophyte in which the reproductive branches arise directly
from the protonema. Any attempt to revise the position of these taxa without evidence from molecular
phylogeny would be futile.
