Abstract
We used molecular phylogenetic and morphological data to reexamine the taxonomic status of Portulaca okinawensis (
P. pilosa subsp. okinawensis) endemic to the central Ryukyu islands, southwestern Japan. Our molecular analyses
showed that P. okinawensis is monophyletic, sister to the clade of P. psammotropha and P. tuberosa and it is not closely
related to P. pilosa subsp. pilosa. Two subclades, one comprising plants from the Okinawa Islands and the other from the
Amami Islands, were recognized. The plants from the Okinawa Islands had more than 20 stamens, orange-yellow
nallowly obovate to oblanceolate petals, and reddish-green stems (as the holotype), while the plants from the Amami
Islands had less than 20 stamens, lemon-colored obovate petals, and bright-green stems. The molecular and
morphological data support a taxonomic treatment of Walker & Tawada (1951) regarding P. okinawensis as a separate
species, also suggesting that the plants from the Amami and Okinawa islands should be treated as different taxa. A new
variety Portulaca okinawensis var. amamiensis was here described.

Introduction
Portulacaceae Juss. is a monotypic family including only Portulaca Linnaeus (1753: 445) (Nyffeler & Eggli
2010). Portulaca includes over 100 species of annuals and perennials and is distributed worldwide (mostly in
the tropics and subtropics) with the center of species diversity in South America and Africa (Ocampo &
Columbus 2012). The Ryukyu Archipelago (the Ryukyus) is located between the Kyushu Island (Japan) and
Taiwan, and comprises about 140 islands (Fig. 1). Three native Portulaca species have been reported in the
Ryukyus (Walker 1976, Shimabuku 1997): the pantropical P. oleracea Linnaeus (1753: 445) from most of the
islands, P. quadrifida Linnaeus (1767: 328) distributed in tropical Asia and Africa but collected only once in
Ikei-jima Island being an islet of the Okinawa Islands, and P. okinawensis Walker & Tawada (1951: 138) [ P.
pilosa Linnaeus (1753:445) subsp. okinawensis (Walker & Tawada) Geesink (1969: 298)]. P. okinawensis was
described by Walker & Tawada (1951) on a specimen collected from Okinawa Island. This taxon rarely occurs
on coastal rocky slopes in the Amami Islands and the Okinawa Islands, and is a critically threatened species in
a Japanese red list (Japanese Ministry of Environment 2012).
Portulaca okinawensis is considered to be endemic to the central Ryukyus that consisted of the Okinawa
and Amami islands (Fig. 1; Hotta 2004, Shinjo & Shinzato 2006). Geesink (1969) recognized P. okinawensis
as subspecies of P. pilosa based on the leaf morphology. Portulaca pilosa subsp. pilosa is native to South
America and widely naturalized in the tropics and subtropics (PIER 2013) including the Ryukyus (Hatusima
1975). The taxonomic concept of Walker & Tawada (1951) was accepted by Momiyama (1982) and Akiyama

(2006), while that of Geesink (1969) was accepted by Hatusima (1975) and Hatusima & Amamo (1994).
Here, we tentatively used the name P. okinawensis and later discuss its taxonomy and proper name based on
our resultant phylogeny.
Aiming to clarify the taxonomic status of P. okinawensis, we carried out molecular phylogenetic analyses
of nuclear ribosomal DNA (ITS). Furthermore, we studied intraspecific taxonomy of P. okinawensis based on
a morphological approach and the ITS-sequence polymorphisms to properly understand the floristic
biodiversity of the Ryukyus and to benefit conservation activities for this critically endangered species.

Materials and Methods
Molecular analyses
DNA sample collection
Samples of P. okinawensis from 12 localities (two samples per locality) in six central Ryukyus islands were
collected and analyzed: Amami Island (4 localities) and Tokuno-shima Island (1) in Amami Islands; Okinawa
Island (4), Geruma Island (1), Aka Island (1) and Tonaki Island (1) in Okinawa Islands (Fig. 1; Table 1). A
collection locality in Onna of Okinawa Island (OK2 in Table 1 and Fig. 1) is the locus classicus of P.
okinawensis.

To test the phylogenetic relationship between P. okinawensis and P. pilosa subsp. pilosa, we need to
incorporate many other congeners in phylogenetic analyses; we therefore utilized ITS (Internal Transcribed
Spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA) data reported in a preceding molecular study of the genus (Ocampo
& Columbus 2012). The ITS sequences of 54 Portulaca species, including P. pilosa subsp. pilosa, were
obtained from GenBank (Table 2). This data set from GenBank also included P. villosa von Chammisso
(1831: 565) [ P. pilosa subsp. villosa (Cham.) Geesink (1969: 297)], which Geesink (1969) recognized as a
morphologically closely related species of P. okinawensis. In addition, our collections of P. psammotropha
Hance (1852: 660), distributing in southern China, southern Taiwan and the northern Philippines (Chung et al.
2008), were included in the analyses, because Walker & Tawada (1951) recognized that this species is
morphologically most similar to P. okinawensis but differs in having axillary hairs. We collected a total of 6
samples of P. psammotropha in three islets of Taiwan (total three localities) (Table 1). Furthermore, our
collection of one plant of P. oleracea from Taiwan was included in the analyses. For outgroups, we followed
preceding studies (Ocampo & Columbus 2010, 2012) and used Talinopsis frutescens A. Gray (1852: 15;
Anacampserotaceae), Pereskia aculeata Miller (1768: without pagination; Cactaceae), and Talinum
paniculatum (von Jacquin 1760: 22) Gaertner (1791: 219; Talinaceae), whose ITS data were also cited from
GenBank (Table 2).
Voucher specimens of our collection were deposited in the herbaria of Academia Sinica, Taipei (HAST)
and the National Museum of Nature and Science, Japan (TNS).

DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencing
For DNA extraction, the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used following the
manufacturer's protocols. The isolated DNA were deposited in the Molecular Biodiversity Research Center of
the National Museum of Nature and Science (Japan).
The amplification of the ITS region (ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2), was made by the polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using an iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The forward primer AB101 (5’-ACG AAT TCA
AGG TCC GGT GAA GTG TTC G-3’) and the reverse primer AB102 (5’-TAG AAT TCC CCG GTT CGC
TCG CCG TTA C-3’) (Douzery et al. 1999) were used for amplification. Amplifications were performed
using Takara LA taq with GC buffer II (Takara, Otsu, Japan) and Ampdirect Plus buffer (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan). The PCR profile comprised 35 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 30 s at 55°C, and 1.5 min at 72°C after an
initial denaturing for 3 min at 94°C. The PCR products were checked by electrophoresis before purification
with ExoSAP-IT (USB Corp., Cleveland, OH, USA).
The cycle sequencing was carried out with a BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit ver. 3.1 (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using PCR primers listed above with the additional internal reverse
primer N2 (5'-GGC GCA ACT TGC GTT CAA-3') and the forward primer N3 (5'-GCT CTC GCA GCA
TCG ATG AAG-3') designated by T. Yukawa (TNS, personal communication). The Sanger sequencing
products were then purified by ethanol precipitation. Automated sequencing was carried out with an Applied
Biosystems 3130xl Genetic Analyzer. The electropherograms were assembled using ATGC ver. 4.01 software
(Genetyx Co., Tokyo, Japan). Sequence data from this study were deposited in the DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of
Japan) databases (since 1983).
Phylogenetic analyses
The DNA sequences were aligned using ClustalW 1.8 software (Thompson et al. 1994) and then manually
adjusted. Phylogenetic analyses were based on a Bayesian approach using MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist &
Huelsenbeck 2003) and a maximum parsimony (MP) criterion using PAUP* version 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002).
In the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, the Hierarchical Likelihood Ratio Tests (hLRT) implemented in
MrModeltest 2.2 (Nylander 2004) was used to estimate the appropriate evolutionary model of nucleotide
substitutions. Based on the model selected, two separate runs of Metropolis coupled Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMCMC) analyses were performed, each with a random starting tree and four chains (one cold and

three heated). The MCMCMC length was one million generations, and the chain was sampled every one
hundredth generation from the cold chain. The first 2500 sample trees (25% of the total 10000 sample trees)
were discarded as burn-in after checking that the average standard deviation of split frequencies (ASDSF)
reached a stationary state at < 0.01 thereafter. As a guide to convergence, the potential scale reduction factors
(PSRFs) were ascertained to be reasonably close to 1.0 for all parameters in an output table. A 50% majority
consensus tree of the output tree file from MrBayes was generated by TREEVIEW (Page 1996).
In the MP phylogenetic analysis, indels were treated as missing data. The characters were treated as
unordered, and the character transformations were equally weighted. The branch collapse option was set to
collapse at a minimum length of zero. A heuristic parsimony search was performed with 200 replicates of
random additions of sequences with ACCTRAN character optimization, tree bisection–reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping, and MULTREES and STEEPEST DESCENT options on. Statistical support for each clade
was assessed by bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein 1985). Ten thousand replicates of heuristic searches, with the
TBR branch swapping switched on and MULTREES options off, were performed to calculate bootstrap
values (BS).
Intraspecific morphological comparison
The following morphological characters of P. okinawensis were examined: number of stigma lobes and
stamens, color and shape of petals, and color of stems. The number of stigma lobes and stamens was studied
fixing the materials in the FAA solution, while the color and shape of the petals and stems were observed in
living plants. A total of 46 samples were examined: 11 plants from Amami Island (4 localities), 5 plants from
Tokuno-shima Island (1), 22 plants from Okinawa Island (4 including the locus classicus of P. okinawensis), 3
plants from Aka Island (1), 3 plants from Geruma Island (1), and 2 plants from Tonaki Island (1) (Table 3).
The equality of variances for the number of the stigma lobes and stamens between the Amami Islands and the
Okinawa Islands was firstly evaluated using the F-test. If the F-test shows equal variances, the Student’s t-test
is applied; if F-test shows no equal variances, the Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction is applied.
The color of the stems was examined in 79 samples from Amami Island (31 plants from 4 localities) and
Tokuno-shima Island (5 from 1), Okinawa Island (28 from 4, holotype included), Aka Island (5 from 1),
Geruma Island (5 from 1), and Tonaki Island (5 from 1). The on-line herbarium database of the National
Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian (2013) was checked for the holotype.
Results
Phylogenetic relationships based on ITS
Four ITS types were found in P. okinawensis: type A in plants collected from Amami Island; type B in plants
from Tokuno-shima Island; type C in plants from Okinawa Island, Aka Island, and Geruma Island; type D in
plants from Tonaki Island. The ITS sequences were identical in the 6 plants of P. psammotropha collected
from 3 localities of Taiwan, and differed from the four ITS types of P. okinawensis. The ITS sequence of P.
oleracea was also different from those of P. okinawensis and P. psammotropha. For these three species, we
used ITS types as operational taxonomic units (OUTs) in the Bayesian and MP phylogenetic analyses. Finally
we obtained 63 OUTs, including six ITS types of the three species obtained herein, 54 accessions as ingroups
and three outgroup accessions obtained from GenBank. After alignment of the 63 OUTs, we obtained a matrix
of 650 bp.
The model of GTR+I+G was selected in the Bayesian analysis. The 50% majority rule consensus tree of
all the post-burn-in trees is depicted with Bayesian posterior probabilities (PPs, Fig. 2). In the MP analysis,
233 of 350 variable characters were parsimony informative in the ITS matrix including the outgroup taxa.
3838 equally most parsimonious trees of 884 steps were obtained with a consistency index (CI) of 0.632, a
retention index (RI) of 0.804, and a rescaled consistency index (RC) of 0.501. The topology of the strict
consensus tree was highly compatible with that of the Bayesian tree, and thus bootstrap percentages (BPs) are
plotted on the Bayesian tree (Fig. 2).

Both the Bayesian and MP analyses (Fig. 2) demonstrated that four ITS types of P. okinawensis formed a
well-supported clade (PP / BS = 1.00 / 98%) including two subclades: the first one comprises the type A
(plants from Amami Island) and the type B (plants from Tokuno-shima Island) (0.98 / 65%), while the other
group comprises the type C (plants from Okinawa, Aka, and Geruma Islands) and the type D (plants from
Tonaki Island) (0.99 / 63%). A sister clade of P. okinawensis includes P. psammotropha and P. tuberosa Roxb.
On the other hand, P. okinawensis and P. pilosa subsp. pilosa were intervened by many species in the
phylogeny and they were not closely related with each other. Portulaca okinawensis and P. villosa ( P. pilosa
subsp. villosa) were comparatively closely related but fell into two different well-supported clades.

Morphological characters
The number of stamens ranged from 12 to 32 in P. okinawensis (Table 3). In the plants from the Amami
Islands, the stamens were 12–15, while in those from the Okinawa Islands were 14–32. The F-test showed
that the variances in the number of the two island groups were not statistically equal (p < 0.0001), and the
Student’s t-test with Welch’s correction was applied. The test showed that there was a significant statistic
difference between the two island groups (p < 0.0001).
The number of stigma lobes was 3–4 in P. okinawensis (Table 3). The F-test showed that the variances of
the two island groups were statistically equal, and the Student’s t-test was applied. The test showed that there
was no significant difference between the two island groups.
The plants collected from the Amami Islands had bright-green stems (Fig. 3A–C); while those from the
Okinawa Islands had reddish-green stems (Fig. 3D–H). Petals of the plants from the Amami Islands were
lemon-colored (Fig. 3A–C). Those from the Okinawa Islands were orange-yellow (Fig. 3D–H). Moreover, the
plants collected from Amami (Fig. 3A & B), Tokuno-shima (Fig. 3C), Aka (Fig. 3H) and Geruma islands had
the petal obovate, while the plants from Okinawa (Fig. 3D–F) and Tonaki (Fig. 3G) islands had nallowly
obovate to oblanceolate petals.
The colors of stems and petals of the holotype (S. Tawada 2221) were degraded and not observable and
not written on the description of P. okinawensis (Walker & Tawada 1951). However, there was a hand-written
note indicating that petal color of the holotype was orange-yellow, and its stem color was reddish on the
specimen sheet.

Discussion
Taxonomic reconsideration of Portulaca okinawensis
Our molecular analysis results disagree with Geesink (1969) showing that P. okinawensis are not closely
related to P. pilosa subsp. pilosa and it cannot be treated at subspecies rank of P. pilosa and revealing that P.
okinawensis and P. villosa ( P. pilosa subsp. villosa) are not conspecific.
Portulaca okinawensis is instead phylogenetically related to P. psammotropha (sensu Chung et al. 2008)
collected from islets of southern Taiwan and P. tuberosa distributed from India, through Malesia, to Christmas
Island of Australia (Puy et al. 1993). However, P. okinawensis is morphologically distinguishable from these

two species by the absence of axillary hairs (Puy et al. 1993, Chung et al. 2008). Therefore, the present
molecular data and morphological difference support the taxonomic concept of Walker & Tawada (1951)
treating P. okinawensis as an independent endemic species to the central Ryukyus.
Intraspecific taxonomy of Portulaca okinawensis
From the morphological point of view, the two subclades of P. okinawensis (from the Amami Islands, and
from the Okinawa Islands), include plants clearly different. The plants from the Amami Islands have brightgreen stems and lemon-colored petals, while plants from the Okinawa Islands have reddish-green stems and
orangey-yellow petals as same as the holotype (S. Tawada 2221). Although the ranges of the number of
stigmas were slightly overlapped between the two groups, the numbers of the former are always less than 20,
and are significantly different from the other. The number of stamens is 25 in the holotype (Walker & Tawada
1951) and this is included in the ranged for the plants from the Okinawa Islands.
We conclude that the plants from the Amami and Okinawa islands should be treated as different
taxonomic entities. A new variety is described below.

Portulaca okinawensis Walker & Tawada var. okinawensis
Type:—JAPAN. The Ryukyus, the Okinawa Islands, Okinawa Island, Onna, 2 October 1949, Tawada 2221 (holotype
US!; available from: http://collections.mnh.si.edu/search/botany/?ti=3).

Description:—Herbs perennial, 3–5 cm tall. Stems not articulated, diffuse, branched basally, ca. 1 mm thick;
basal stems woody, prostrate, upper stems herbaceous, upright, reddish green. Root fleshy, much-branched.
Leaves spirally arranged to alternate, subsessile, without axillary hairs; leaf blade 2–3 mm thick, oblong to
obovate, 5–8 mm long, base obtuse, apex obtuse or rounded. Flowers solitary, about 10–15 mm in diameter.
Sepals 2, ovate-deltate, about 2 mm long. Petals 5, obovate to nallowly obovate, orangey yellow, mostly
without margins overlapping. Stamens 12–15. Ovary ovoid. Stigma usually trilobed or tetralobed; capsule
glossy, 2–4 mm long, 2–3 mm wide.
Distribution and habitat:—The Ryukyus, the Okinawa Islands, Okinawa, Aka, Geruma, Tonaki islands.
Coastal rocky slopes, xeric, saline, and exposed to direct sunlight. Portulaca okinawensis has also been recorded
from Aka, Geruma, Yakabi, Tonaki, Aguni, and Kume islands of the Okinawa Islands (Shinjo & Shinzato
2006). We have not collected samples from these islands. We examined a herbarium specimen of P. okinawensis
collected from Yakabi Island (Miyagi 8414, RYU, collected in 1978) but we could not identify it at variety level
because of the difficulty in counting of the number of stamens and the discoloring of the petals and stems.
Additional specimens examined:—JAPAN. The Ryukyus, the Okinawa Islands: Okinawa Island,
