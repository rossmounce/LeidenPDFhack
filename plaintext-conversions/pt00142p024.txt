Abstract
A new genus, Gabonius is described to accommodate a single species, Gabonius ngouniensis which was previously
misplaced in Hymenostegia sensu lato. Gabonius ngouniensis is a widespread Gabonese endemic of evergreen forest. We
assess G. ngouniensis as Least Concern (LC) according to IUCN criteria. A distribution map of Gabonius is presented, as
is a table comparing the morphology of Gabonius, the closely related, possibly sister genus Micklethwaitia and
Hymenostegia sensu stricto from which G. ngouniensis has been excluded. The previously unreported seedling
morphology is discussed.

Introduction
The Legumes are one of the most important plant families in the world, both in terms of species richness (third
largest family after composites and orchids) and in economic importance where they are arguably as valuable
as the grasses (Lewis et al. 2005). Subfamily Caesalpinioideae has its widest generic diversification in Africa.
The main source of this diversification is found in one of the earliest branches of the family, the Detarieae, a
tribe that consists solely of woody plants, the majority trees (Mackinder 2005). Detarieae are considered an
important ecological component of both rain forest and woodland systems in Africa. In the wettest forests of
Africa, especially those on phosphorus-poor soils, Detarieae species dominate the canopy layer, with up to
60% of the trees belonging to this tribe, a phenomenon commonly attributed to the ectomycorrhizal symbioses
of these trees (Newbery et al. 1997, Wieringa 1999, Ba et al. 2012). One widespread African woodland type,
Miombo woodland, is a formation dominated by Brachystegia Benth. in Bentham & Hooker (1865: 582)
alone or together with species of Julbernardia Pellegrin (1943: 297) or Isoberlinia Craib & Stapf ex Holland
(1911: 266–267). All three genera are members of Detarieae.
From a taxonomic point of view, one of the most problematic areas of the Detarieae is the genus
Cynometra Linné (1753: 382–383) and some of the genera that have been derived from it in the past, such as
Plagiosiphon Harms in Engler & Prantl (1897: 194), Scorodophloeus Harms (1901: 77), Talbotiella Baker f.
(1914: 2), Lebruniodendron Léonard (1951: 421) and in particular Hymenostegia Harms in Engler & Prantl
(1897: 193). While Cynometra is a pantropical genus, Hymenostegia as currently circumscribed, is endemic to
Africa, and is under the scrutiny of the first two authors using a combined morphological and molecular
approach. Prior to our studies 16 species were recognised in the genus, 15 by Léonard (1951) with one

addition by Aubréville (1970). Since then one species has been removed to Talbotiella (Mackinder et al. 2011)
and three species new to science have been added (Mackinder & Wieringa 2013a, Wieringa & Mackinder
2012) bringing the current total to 18 species. However, we consider eight of these species not to be
congeneric with H. floribunda (Bentham, 1866: 318) Harms in Engler & Prantl (1897: 193), the type species
of Hymenostegia. Those species which do not belong in the genus need to be fostered in existing genera or in
genera newly described to accommodate them. This paper deals with one such transfer, that of H. ngouniensis
Pellegrin (1942: 247) to a new genus: Gabonius. Together with the transfer of 2 species to Annea Mackinder
& Wieringa (2013b) this brings the total number of species recognised in Hymenostegia to 15, of which still
five await further data and analyses before they can be placed and assigned to other genera.

Reasons for recognising Gabonius: indications from DNA and morphology
DNA. Two published phylogenetic studies of Detarieae, both based on trnL plastid nucleotide sequence data
(Bruneau et al. 2000, 2001), and a third study based on rbcL data (Mackinder et al. 2010) sampled Gabonius
(as Hymenostegia ngouniensis). Each study resolved a well-supported clade containing a core group of
Hymenostegia sensu stricto species from which Gabonius was excluded yet there was no agreement among
the studies as to which taxa Gabonius was most closely related. The position of Gabonius was either
unresolved (Bruneau et al. 2000), resolved, with weak support as sister to members of the Afzelia clade
(Bruneau et al. 2001) or resolved with moderate support among members of the Berlinia clade (Mackinder et
al. 2010). However, a phylogenetic analysis of subfamily Caesalpinioideae based on a combined trnL and
matK dataset (Bruneau et al. 2008) placed Gabonius ngouniensis with very strong support (Bayesian
Posterior Probability of 1.00) as sister to a lineage consisting of Scorodophloeus zenkeri Harms (1901: 78)
and Annea afzelii (Oliver 1871: 318) Mackinder & Wieringa (2013b). More recently a phylogenetic analysis
was undertaken of the Amherstieae clade which is a large subclade of Detarieae accommodating over 40
genera including all those referred to in the present paper. The Amherstieae clade analysis (Mackinder et al.
2013c) was also based on combined trnL and matK data but incorporated species-level sampling additional to
that of Bruneau et al. (2008). Findings of the Amherstieae clade analysis were consistent with Bruneau et al.
(2008). Gabonius was placed on a separate lineage in a strongly supported clade comprised of seven species
grouping into four lineages that we consider genera. In addition to Gabonius, the clade included a
monophyletic Scorodophloeus (3/3 species sampled), a monophyletic Annea (both species sampled), and the
monotypic genus Micklethwaitia Lewis & Schrire (2004: 166) to which Gabonius was resolved as sister,
albeit with weak support.
Morphology. In a study of vegetative morphology which examined all Hymenostegia sensu lato species
alongside representatives of several putatively allied genera, Cynometra, Lebruniodendron, Plagiosiphon,
Scorodophloeus and Leonardoxa Aubréville (1968b), Gabonius (as Hymenostegia ngouniensis) presented a
unique combination of key vegetative characters among the wider study group (Mackinder et al. 2010) with
several differences from Hymenostegia sensu stricto. Morphological characters that can be used to distinguish
Gabonius from Hymenostegia sensu stricto and Micklethwaitia are presented in Table 1. Gabonius also can be
readily distinguished from the other genera with which it is considered closely related (Bruneau et al. 2008,
Mackinder et al. 2013c). Compared to Gabonius, Scorodophloeus has alternate (not opposite) leaflets,
caducous (not persistent) bracteoles, 5 (not 3) large petals and pods with winged (not unwinged) upper
sutures. Annea (compared to Gabonius) has fewer leaflet pairs, 1 or 2 (not typically 5 or more pairs), a marked
disparity in the size of different leaflets pairs (not subequal), fused stipules (not free), shorter stamens,
filaments up to 13 mm (not 20 mm or greater) long, and a shallower hypanthium 2–4 (not 6–9) mm deep. In
addition, Gabonius has pods that are larger than those of any of these other genera. Within Detarieae,
Gabonius belongs to a limited group of genera that show 3 large and 2 reduced petals. Next to Annea and
Hymenostegia also Plagiosiphon, Neochevalierodendron and Loesenera share this character. In contrast to
Gabonius, Plagiosiphon has emarginate leaflets and velutinous pods, Loesenera white to pink petals and

velutinous pods while Neochevalierodendron has an alternate first leaflet pair with a strong marginal vein at
base, united stipules, caducous bracteoles and large nearly circular white petals.

Gabonius Wieringa & Mackinder gen. nov.
Type: Hymenostegia ngouniensis, for type specimen details see below.

Shrub or tree, usually small but may attain 35 m tall. Stipules in pairs, free but touching at the base, caducous.
Bud scales absent. Leaves paripinnate, leaflets in (2–)5–7 pairs, subsessile, narrowly elliptic to elliptic, ovate
to sub-rhombate, adaxial surface glabrous, abaxial surface glabrous or with sparse indumentum, crater-like
glands present, visible at × 10 or higher magnification. Inflorescence a terminal or axillary raceme, axes
puberulous, bracts caducous, bracteoles persistent, opposite, petaloid, conspicuous, adaxial surfaces touching
along margins prior to anthesis. Petals 5, adaxial and lateral petals large, yellow and white, similar in size,
abaxial petals smaller, white. Stamens 10. Ovary stipitate, the stipe fused along most of its length to the
adaxial sidewall of the hypanthium, densely hairy along the margins, stigma peltate. Pod compressed,
glabrous, trapeziform, broadest at about one-third distance from the apex, dehiscent. Seeds 1–2, discoid.
Etymology:—This new, so far monotypic genus is named after Gabon, a country where it is not only
endemic to, but in which it also occurs over a large extent; the known distribution seems to fit that country
very well, and a species distribution model of the species (see below) predicts it is more or less confined to
this country as well. Although Gabon has a large number of endemics, c. 500 species are recorded as endemic
and another 100 as near endemic (Sosef et al. 2006), only a few of these species have such a large distribution
within the country. Gabonius has the male gender.
Note:—The only slightly similar name that exists is Gabunia Stapf (1902: 136), but that name differs in
several letters and is a synonym of Tabernaemontana Linné (1753: 210–211) (Apocynaceae) with no current
use, so we do not foresee any possibilities for confusion between these two.

Since we have chosen to name this genus after Gabon, we decided to test the likelihood that the taxon
distribution is indeed limited to Gabon. To assess this we generated a Species Distribution Model (SDM). For
generating SDM’s based on presence-only data as in this case, MaxEnt has been documented to outperform
other methods (Elith et al. 2006). As the foreseen distribution is limited to Gabon and possibly to
neighbouring countries, we used a 30 arc-sec resolution and applied the analysis to a study area ranging from
8º N to 8º S and from 6 to 24º E, thus roughly encompassing the countries of Gabon, Equatorial Guinea,
Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sao Tomé & Principe. The collecting localities of all
herbarium vouchers examined in this study were used as input species data. Environmental layers used for
model building and projection include 19 BIOCLIM variables (Hijmans et al. 2005). In addition, the range as
well as standard deviation of altitude based on SRTM DEM 90 × 90 m data, obtained through
(<srtm.csi.cgiar.org>, accessed 07-10-2011) within each grid cell was calculated and added as variables to act
as a proxy for ruggedness of the landscape. Finally, soil parameters of the dominant soil type within each grid
cell were extracted from the Harmonised World Soil Database (<http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/
External-World-soil-database/HTML/index.html?sb=1> accessed 16-08-2012). Environmental parameters
were checked for multi-collinearity separately for climatic and altitude data as well as for soil data. To avoid
overfitting and errors due to multi-collinearity, only uncorrelated parameters were used for model building
(Pearson r < 0.65 or Spearman Rho < 0.65). This resulted in the selection of the following parameters:
temperature annual range (BIO7), mean temperature of coldest quarter (BIO11), annual precipitation
(BIO12), precipitation seasonality (BIO15), precipitation of warmest quarter (BIO18), precipitation of coldest
quarter (BIO19), altitude range (DEM-range), available water capacity range (AWC_CLASS, categorical
variable), topsoil bulk density (T_BULK_DENSITY), topsoil calcium carbonate (T_CACO3), topsoil salinity
(T_ECE), topsoil sodicity (T_ESP), topsoil gravel content (T_GRAVEL), topsoil organic carbon (T_OC),
topsoil pH H2O (T_PH_H2O), topsoil sand fraction (T_SAND), topsoil base saturation (T_BS) and topsoil
cation exchange capacity of the clay fraction (T_CEC_CLAY, categorical variable). Models were built using
MaxEnt V.3.3.3.k (Phillips et al. 2004) applying the default features. In addition a presence / absence
distribution map was generated applying a 10 percentile trainings threshold, meaning that 10% of the training
locations are allowed to fall outside the predicted distribution, which is assumed to correct for errors in
identification and estimation of locations.
The final model was generated using 41 presence records; the result is shown in fig. 3. The Area Under
the Curve (AUC) of our model has a value of 0.990, which lies well above the critical threshold of 0.7. As the
use of AUC has been highly criticised (Peterson et al. 2008), we also tested the model against a null model
(Raes & Ter Steege 2007) resulting in a rank number of 100 (out of 100) clearly indicating that the model
performs significantly better than random. Based on the predicted potential distribution, Gabonius is nearly
endemic for the country of Gabon. The predicted presence on Sao Tomé, as displayed in fig. 3, is not realistic
as Sao Tomé is a non-continental island located approx. 250 km off the coastline of Gabon which is
impossible to reach for a species with explosive seed dispersal like Gabonius ngouniensis. Moreover, this
island is of volcanic origin, with phosphorus-rich soils, which in general are not favourable for Detarieae as
discussed above. The only place where Gabonius might occur outside of Gabon is just over the border in
Equatorial Guinea; so far the species has not been found in that area.
Conservation:—Gabonius ngouniensis is widespread in Gabon with an A00 of 38137 km2 (cell size 46
km) and an E00 of 72300 km2 and occurs within the borders of several National Parks. It is assessed here as
Least Concern (LC) according to the criteria of IUCN (2001).
Notes:—Small scars observed on the seedling axis suggest the abscission of a reduced first pair of
opposite leaves. At the point of abscission, the epicotyl continues without any signs of transformation into a
first stem, suggesting growth is not paused when the reduced first pair of leaves appears. As such this
represents a transition between two commonly observed seedling morphologies in Detarieae (Léonard 1957).
They are (i) seedlings that possess a clear epicotyl and an opposite first leaf pair indicating a pause in growth
while this first pair fully develops, for example Talbotiella korupensis Mackinder & Wieringa (Mackinder et

20 •

WIERINGA ET AL.

al. 2011: 411) and (ii) seedlings that immediately start producing a shoot with alternative leaves, for example
Annea afzelii. This apparent presence of a reduced first leaf pair in Gabonius seedlings represents a (so far)
unique morphology in Detarieae. Functionally we consider the seedlings to belong to type (ii) since growth
continues beyond the first reduced leaves. We think it unlikely the reduced leaves are functional given they do
not persist (see also Mackinder et al. 2013c).

FIGURE 3. Potential distribution of Gabonius ngouniensis according to our species distribution model. The habitat suitability value
0.3594 corresponds to the 10th percentile training presence threshold as applied to generate a presence/absence distribution map.

Bark with Green bean-odour (Dibata 132). Freshly dried material has a “nut-like” smell (van der Burgt 1).
Several collectors note the flowers are fragrant.
The epithet was written as “ngouniensis” by Pellegrin in 1942, but in a later publication that is much more
widely available (Pellegrin 1949: 90) he spelled it as “ngounyensis”. Since Aubréville (1968a) in his flora
treatment also used the later spelling, this spelling currently prevails in publications and databases. Since the
epithet refers to a geographical name, its spelling should follow that of the original protologue and is not to be
corrected.
In the Flore du Gabon treatment, Aubréville (1968a: 102) lists Le Testu 5890 (P) as the holotype. This is
incorrect, since the protologue mentions two collections (Le Testu 5284 & Le Testu 5890) but does not
indicate a holotype. Moreover, this cannot be seen as a lectotypification since a lectotype had already been
selected by Léonard (1951: 441), who selected 5284.
