Abstract
Relict assemblages of arctic, sub-arctic, and boreal diatoms were found intact in two undisturbed floating-mat fens at 47o
north latitude and 1,830 m elevation in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, USA. The fens support Encyonema
droseraphilum sp. nov. and several rare northern/alpine diatom species—including eleven apparent first records for the
contiguous United States—and three species of vascular plants that are imperiled in Montana. For many of the diatoms
and one of the vascular plants, the fens are at the southern limit of their known distributions in North America. Twentyseven of the 49 diatom taxa in the fens are considered at risk or declining in Germany, and similar ratings appear to be
appropriate for these taxa in Montana, especially in light of global warming and human destruction of wetlands. A
nearby wetland that has been disturbed by dam-building activities of beaver (Castor canadensis), but not by human
landscape alterations, produced a diatom assemblage that contained three times more taxa than the fens but was
dominated by common species, primarily Staurosirella pinnata. Our findings illustrate the effects of natural, intermediate
disturbance on diatom species composition and underscore the importance of protecting undisturbed aquatic systems for
the purpose of conserving rare species and for monitoring environmental change.

Introduction
Peatlands occur mostly in northern latitudes where cool, humid climates allow for precipitation to exceed
evapotranspiration. Peatlands are best developed on low elevation, nearly level landforms having some degree
of impeded drainage. The most extensive and continuous tracts of peatland are found in northern North
America—notably in Canada and Alaska—and in northern Europe and Asia. Peatlands in the contiguous USA
tend to be smaller and more isolated, and most are scattered among the northern tier of states and southward
along major cordillera—the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains—where moderate elevation gain may
compensate thermally for more southerly latitudes (Rydin & Jelgum 2006).
Peatlands are characterized by extreme environmental conditions not found in other wetland ecosystems.
Cold, anaerobic, and nutrient-poor conditions limit decay of organic matter. Because the rate of organic matter
accumulation exceeds the rate of decomposition, peatlands are autogenic or “self-creating” habitats. The
resulting organic substrates support a number of uncommon plant communities. Due to their great masses of
water-holding organic matter, peatlands are extremely stable at intermediate time scales and may persist for
centuries. In the United States, the combination of habitat rarity, habitat stability, and extreme habitat
conditions explain the distinctiveness of peatland vascular plant floras, as well as the high concentrations of
rare species that are restricted to peatland environments (Bedford & Godwin 2003, Chadde et al. 1998, Rydin
& Jelgum 2006). Diatom floristic studies of peatlands in the USA have typically recorded new and rare
species (e.g., Reimer 1961, Stoermer 1963).

In the Northern Rocky Mountains, peatlands are uncommon and occur mainly at lower elevations. In this
region, they are represented by fens, with their water sources consisting of both groundwater and
precipitation. They are even rarer southward in the Rockies, where intense solar radiation may be unfavorable
for peatland plants (Larsen 1982). Intense solar radiation, summer dry periods, and steep terrain may inhibit
peat development at higher elevations in the Northern Rockies (Chadde et al. 1998). Several plant species
found in peatlands range southward along the Rocky Mountains and reach their southern limit in Montana.
Twenty-one species of vascular plants from peatlands in the Northern Rockies have been designated as
species of special conservation concern by the Montana Natural Heritage Program (http://mtnhp.org/), and 15
of these have been designated as sensitive species by the US Forest Service (Chadde et al. 1998). These
species, although uncommon in the Northern Rockies, are generally secure in other parts of their ranges. All
of these rare Montana peatland species are boreal or north-temperate in distribution, and disjunct or peripheral
in Montana from more continuous ranges to the north (Chadde et al. 1998).
Floating-mat fens are a classic feature of basin or lake-fill peatlands. Roots and rhizomes of living plants
and accumulated leaf litter intertwine to form a mat that develops horizontally across the water surface and
floats or overlies very unstable muck below. Floating mats are ecologically stable communities because of
their ability to adjust to fluctuating water levels. Floating mats have been reported to move vertically by as
much as 0.75 m annually. Plant roots remain in constant contact with water and the plants avoid the
inundation and drying that affect fixed or anchored mats (Chadde et al. 1998).

Materials and methods
Site description and sample collection
Indian Meadows Research Natural Area (IMRNA) is located on the Helena National Forest in western
Montana about 90 km northwest of Helena, Montana (Fig. 1). IMRNA lies at the extreme southern end of the
Canadian Rockies Ecoregion, a largely pristine, highly glaciated subregion of the Northern Rockies (USEPA
2000). IMRNA occupies a glaciated bench bordered by low hills at the head of Indian Meadows Creek, a first
order tributary of the Blackfoot River. Elevations within the IMRNA range from 1692–2034 m. The area
includes a diverse mix of vegetation types ranging from montane and lower subalpine conifer forests to
aquatic features such as ponds, fens, and wet meadows. At the end of the Pleistocene much of the area was left
covered by mixed glacial deposits. These deposits are underlain by Tertiary age rocks, which consist of
volcanic tuffs near the south boundary (fen 4525) and unconsolidated sandstones and siltstones, composed of
quartzites and argillites, near the north boundary (beaver pond 1241, fen 4526). Except for general
atmospheric and climatic influences, the IMRNA is undisturbed by human landscape alterations. It is located
at the southern limit of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex and part of the natural area lies within the
Scapegoat Wilderness (USDA 1997).
Two floating-mat fens, one with a central pool of open water (Fig. 2), are the most distinguishing features
of IMRNA. These fens support three species of vascular plants that are imperiled in Montana: Drosera
anglica Huds. (English or great sundew), Drosera linearis Goldie (slenderleaf or linear-leaf sundew), and
Schoenoplectus subterminalis (Torr.) Soják (swaying or water bulrush, fen 4525 only) (http://mtnhp.org/).
The rarest of these is Drosera linearis: the fens at IMRNA support two of only four Montana populations of
this species and the fens are at the southern limit of the species’ known distribution in North America.
We collected a composite sample of surface material from near the center of each fen and from an
abandoned beaver pond nearby (Fig. 1, insert). Samples from the fens were composed of material squeezed
from peat, Sphagnum, and other vegetation, and of material in the interstitial water that surfaced in
depressions created by footfalls on the floating mats. The sample from the beaver pond consisted of surface
sediment, material squeezed from plants, and scrapings from rocks and logs. Samples were preserved with
Lugols’ iodine solution (IKI) before transporting them to the lab. Specific conductance and pH were measured
in the field with a Hanna Instruments waterproof meter, model 98129, or a Horiba U-10 water quality checker.

Sample preparation
Samples were treated with concentrated sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, and hydrogen peroxide to remove
organic matter. After repeated dilutions of the treated material with distilled water, aliquots were dried on cover
glasses and permanent mounts were prepared in Naphrax. A proportional count of 800 valves was conducted
on one slide from each site at 1000X. Each slide was then scanned and additional taxa were recorded until the
time required to find another taxon exceeded 10 minutes. In this way a comprehensive list of diatoms was

constructed for each site. For counting, scanning, and LM photographs, we used a Leica DM LB2 research
microscope with DIC optics and a Spot Insight Model 14.0 monochrome digital camera. SEM images were
taken with a Hitachi S-4700 Type II cold field emission SEM at the Electron Microscopy Facility in the
Division of Biological Sciences at the University of Montana. Samples were filtered, air-dried, and mounted
on aluminum stubs, then sputter coated with gold and palladium using a Pelco Model 3 Sputter Coater.
Slides containing holotype specimens of the new taxon are deposited in the Montana Diatom Collection
(MDC) at the University of Montana Herbarium (MONTU) in Missoula. Duplicate slides containing isotype
specimens have been deposited in the MDC in Helena and in the Diatom Herbarium at the Academy of
Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP).

Results
Diatom assemblage composition
The abandoned beaver pond supported 126 diatom taxa, but over half of the valves (51%) belonged to
Staurosirella pinnata (Ehrenberg) Williams & Round (1987: 274) (Table 2). Other taxa from the beaver pond
that contributed more than 2% of the valves were all common, widespread forms: Pseudostaurosira brevistriata
(Grunow) Williams & Round (1987: 276) (3.5%), Staurosira venter (Ehrenberg) Grunow (1882: 139) (3.2%),
Navicula cryptocephala Kützing (1844: 95) (2.7%), Achnanthidium minutissimum (Kützing) Czarnecki (1994:
157) (2.6%), Cocconeis placentula Ehrenberg (1838: 194) (2.6%), Aulacoseira italica (Ehrenberg) Simonsen
(1979: 60) (2.4%), and Staurosira construens var. pumila (Grunow) Kingston (2000: 409) (2.4%).
Contrasted to the high species richness of the beaver pond assemblage, the fens supported only 49 taxa
(36 and 35 each) (Table 2). The fens also supported much more distinctive diatom assemblages composed
largely of uncommon taxa. One taxon from the fens could not be identified using available floras and
monographs. Ten taxa from the fens are not listed by Bahls (2009) in a checklist of diatoms from the
northwestern United States and eleven are not listed by Kociolek (2005) in a checklist of diatoms from the
contiguous United States (Table 2). We also show the conservation status for these fen species in Germany,
where 27 of the 49 taxa are considered at risk or declining (Table 2). Below we discuss our rationale for
consulting the German list as a surrogate list of imperiled diatoms for Montana.

Similar taxa:—This taxon is distinguished from Encyonema silesiacum (Bleisch in Rabenhorst) D.G. Mann
(1990: 667) by its longer length-to-breadth ratio, more widely spaced dorsal striae, shorter ventral striae, and
shape of the internal proximal raphe ends. Valve ends are directed ventrally, not laterally as in E. silesiacum
var. elegans Krammer. This appears to be the same taxon as the Encyonema sp. from Kitzbühel, Schwarzsee,
Österreich reported by Krammer (1997a, pl. 8, figs 6, 7).

Etymology:—Drosera refers to the genus of sundews, which are common associates of this diatom at the
type locality; philum is from the Greek philus, which means “loving”.

Rare taxa and new records
Here we provide morphological features, ecological information, and distribution records for selected rare
taxa, including taxa recorded here for the first time from the northwestern USA and/or the contiguous USA
(see Table 2).
Encyonopsis neoamphioxys Krammer (1997b: p. 142, pl. 168, figs 1–7). One specimen measures 42 µm
long, 5 µm wide. Striae number 13–15 in 10 µm. The type locality of this taxon is “Kitzbühel, Schwarzsee,
Österreich”, the same locality from which Krammer (1997a) reported our “new” Encyonema. Encyonopsis
neoamphioxys has been reported by several authors from oligotrophic waters in northern/alpine regions.
Eunotia arculus Lange-Bertalot & Nörpel in Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1991: p. 213, pl. 157, figs 4–
12). Valves are 18–50 µm long, 4 µm wide. Striae number 18–20 in 10 µm. Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1991)
reported Eunotia arculus from northern Europe in weakly acid standing waters with low conductivity. In North
America, Eunotia arculus has been reported from lakes in northern Quebec and Labrador (Fallu et al. 2000).
Gomphonema hebridense Gregory (1854: 607). Cleve-Euler 1955, p. 181, fig. 1274; Lange-Bertalot &
Metzeltin 1996, pl. 64, figs 18–25, pl. 98, fig. 1. Valves are 21–47 µm long, 5–7 µm wide. Large specimens
are tumid in the middle and tend to be cymbelloid. Striae number 15–20 in 10 µm. Gomphonema hebridense
has been reported as a northern-alpine species from Austria, Germany, and Finland (Cleve-Euler 1955, LangeBertalot & Metzeltin 1996). In the USA, it has been found in low numbers in nine streams in western Montana
and western Oregon (Bahls 2009), where mean pH is 6.8 and mean conductance is 247 µS/cm (Montana
Diatom Database, unpublished data).
Kobayasiella okadae (Skvortzov) Lange-Bertalot (1999a: 267). Nagumo & Kobayasi 1990, p. 368, figs 1–
16. Synonym: Navicula hoefleri Cholnoky & Schinder (1953: 607). Valves are 31–37 µm long, 7–8 µm wide.
Striae number 22–24 in 10 µm in the middle of the valve and 36–38 in 10 µm toward the ends. Kobayasiella
okadae is typically found together with K. parasubtilissima (Kobayasi & Nagumo) Lange-Bertalot (1999a:
268) and K. subtilissima (Cleve) Lange-Bertalot (1999a: 268) in slightly acid waters in arctic to subarctic
zones, and in temperate regions (Nagumo & Kobayasi 1990). Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986) report K.
okadae (as Navicula hoefleri) from Scandinavia and the Alps. Lange-Bertalot & Metzeltin (1996) found K.
okadae (reported as Naviculadicta hoefleri) in a Finnish lake that has low levels of conductance and inorganic
nutrients and a high level of humic acid. In the United States, K. okadae had been reported (as Navicula
hoefleri) only from a few oligotrophic and low conductivity lakes in New York (Camburn & Charles 2000) and
Wisconsin (Diatom Paleolimnology Data Cooperative, Patrick Center, The Academy of Natural Sciences).
Kobayasiella parasubtilissima (Kobayasi & Nagumo) Lange-Bertalot (1999a: 268). Kobayasi & Nagumo
1988, p. 245, figs 19–37. Synonym: Navicula parasubtilissima Kobayasi & Nagumo (1988: 245, 247). Valves
are 31–37 µm long, 3–5 µm wide. Striae number 40–42 in 10 µm. This taxon was described from the same
material from which Cleve described Navicula (Kobayasiella) subtilissima Cleve (1891: 37): Lake Imandra,
Russian Lapland. Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986) report this taxon (as Navicula subtilissima) from high
moors in the Alps and Scandinavia, usually associated with Sphagnum species. Fallu et al. (2000) reported
Navicula parasubtilissima (from lakes in northern Québec and Labrador. In the United States, K.
parasubtilissima has been reported (as Navicula parasubtilissima) from low alkalinity lakes in the Northeast

(Camburn & Charles 2000). Kobayasiella parasubtilissima has been reported (as Kobayasiella subtilissima)
from 19 lakes and streams in Montana and Washington (Bahls 2009), where mean pH is 7.5 and mean
conductance is 116 µS/cm (Montana Diatom Database, unpublished data).
Kobayasiella subtilissima (Cleve) Lange-Bertalot (1999a: 268). Kobayasi & Nagumo 1988, p. 240, figs 1–
18. Synonyms: Navicula subtilissima, (?) Navicula pseudobryophila Hustedt (1942: 114). Valves are 22–24
µm long, 5 µm wide. Striae number about 36 in 10 µm. This taxon was described by Cleve from material
collected in Lake Imandra, Russian Lapland, at approximately 68o north latitude. Fallu et al. (2000) reported
Navicula subtilissima from lakes in northern Québec and Labrador. In the United States, Kobayasiella
subtilissima has been reported (as Kobayasia subtilissima) from the Great Lakes (Stoermer et al. 1999).
Following Krammer & Lange-Bertalot (1986), we had identified this taxon as Navicula pseudobryophila
Hustedt (Simonsen 1987), which has the same morphological features as Kobayasiella subtilissima. Krammer
& Lange-Bertalot (1986) report N. pseudobryophila from high moors in the Alps and Scandinavia, usually
associated with Sphagnum. In the Northwest, we have six records for Navicula pseudobryophila, from
California, Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming (Bahls 2009).
Navicula heimansioides Lange-Bertalot (2001: p. 87, pl. 40, figs 10–15). One valve measures 45 µm long, 6
µm wide. Striae number 14 in 10 µm at the center to 18 in 10 µm toward the ends. Navicula heimansioides
may be distinguished from Navicula leptostriata Jørgensen (1948: 59) and Navicula notha Wallace (1960: 4)
by its larger size (Lange-Bertalot 2001). Navicula heimansioides is widespread in electrolyte poor,
circumneutral to weakly acid, oligotrophic waters. This appears to be the first published record of this taxon in
the USA. In the Northwest, we have 43 records of this taxon from California, Idaho, Montana, and Oregon,
where mean pH is 7.0 and mean conductance is 134 µS/cm (Montana Diatom Database, unpublished data).
Pinnularia polyonca (Brébisson) W. Smith (1856: 95). Krammer 2000, p. 90, pl. 95, figs 1–7. Valves are
lanceolate, somewhat triundulate, widest in the middle, ends capitate and rounded. Valves measure 70–74 µm
long, 9–10 µm wide. Striae consistently number 10 in 10 µm. Raphe lateral, the outer fissure weakly curved,
proximal raphe ends small, bent to one side and close together. Distal raphe fissures large, ?-shaped. Axial
area ¼ to ½ width of the valve, lanceolate and widening from the ends to a broad central area. This taxon is
very rare; we found only two frustules—one on each of two slides. Scans of 10 additional slides that were
made from sample 4526 failed to produce another frustule. In our specimens, one or two slightly longer striae
occur in the central area on one side, which is a feature also shown by Siver et al. (2005) for specimens
collected from Cape Cod (Massachusetts, USA). Krammer (1992, 2000) reports P. polyonca from Bavaria and
as a “zonal element of the palaearctic region, rare, always isolated, [and in] waters of low electrolyte content”.
We have only one other record of P. polyonca from the Pacific Northwest (Bahls 2009) and that is from Fish
Lake in Glacier National Park.
Pinnularia rhombarea Krammer in Metzeltin & Lange-Bertalot (1998: 185–186). Krammer 2000, p. 75,
pl. 53, figs 1–10; pl. 54, figs 1–5. Valves measure 61–64 µm long, 11 µm wide. Striae number 9–10 in 10 µm.
P. rhombarea was previously subsumed as Morphotype 3 of P. microstauron (Ehrenberg) Cleve (1891: 28)
(Krammer 1992). Fallu et al. (2000) found Pinnularia microstauron Morphotype 3 in lakes in northern
Quebec and Labrador. Krammer (2000) reports that Pinnularia rhombarea prefers cold, oligotrophic waters
with low electrolyte content, in northern and subarctic regions. We have three other records of P. rhombarea
from the Northwest (Bahls 2009) and all three are from lakes and fens in Glacier National Park.
Stauroneis acidoclinatopsis Van de Vijver & Lange-Bertalot (2004: p. 16, pl. 57, figs 1–9). Valves are 57–
61 µm long, 10–12 µm wide. Striae number 24 in 10 µm (constant). Areolae number 22–24 in 10 µm.
Stauroneis acidoclinatopsis was described from Qeqertarsuaq, West Greenland (69o N latitude), where it was
found in a small shallow pool with slightly acid water (pH 6.0), low conductance (<50 µS/cm), and very low

nutrient levels (Van de Vijver et al. 2004). Besides the fens at Indian Meadows, we have records of this
species from 3 wetlands and small lakes in western Montana (Bahls 2010).
Stauroneis heinii Lange-Bertalot & Krammer in Lange-Bertalot & Genkal (1999: p. 91, pl. 27, figs 1–4).
Valves are elliptic lanceolate with protracted ends, 116–167 µm long, 23–30 µm wide. Striae number 15–17 in
10 µm and areolae number 16–18 in 10 µm. External proximal raphe fissures are strongly inflated and
strongly curved. Stauroneis heinii is bipolar, having been reported from South Georgia Island (Van de Vijver
et al. 2004) and in the Andes Mountains from Venezuela to Patagonia (Rumrich et al. 2000), as well as from
the Canadian Arctic (Antoniades et al. 2008), Greenland (Van Kerckvoorde et al. 2000), Siberia (LangeBertalot & Genkal 1999), Alaska (Hein 1990), and elsewhere in western Montana, where it prefers slightly
acid to circumneutral waters with low concentrations of electrolytes (Bahls 2009, 2010).
Stauroneis indianopsis Bahls (2010: 85–86). Valves are linear in small specimens to linear-lanceolate in
larger specimens. Apices appear pinched, very slightly protracted. Length 105–150 µm, breadth 20–25 µm.
Axial area narrow, barely widening near the central area. Stauros narrow, linear or slightly expanded toward
the valve margins. Raphe fissures lateral, proximal ends weakly inflated and strongly curved; terminal raphe
fissures hooked. Striae radiate throughout, more so near ends, 16–17 in 10 µm. Areolae 16–18 in 10 µm.
Stauroneis indianopsis was described elsewhere (Bahls 2010) from material collected at IMRNA. It is also
known from a small lake in Missoula County, Montana, having a pH of 7.5 and conductance of 10 µS/cm
(Bahls 2010).
Stauroneis regina Bahls (2010: 123-124). Valves are narrowly lanceolate with rounded ends that are not or
only slightly protracted. Length 142–213 µm, breadth 22–33 µm. Axial area narrow, widening slightly near
the central area. Stauros narrow, rectangular, widening slightly toward the valve margins. Outer raphe fissures
lateral, proximal endings inflated and curved. Terminal raphe fissures are hooked. Striae radiate throughout,
15–17 in 10 µm. Areolae 15–18 in 10 µm. Stauroneis regina was described elsewhere (Bahls 2010) from
material collected at site 4525, IMRNA. Stauroneis regina is widely distributed in ponds, small lakes, and
wetlands in the northern Rocky Mountains, where it prefers circumneutral waters with low concentrations of
electrolytes (Bahls 2010). Stauroneis regina may be conspecific with S. supergracilis Van de Vijver & LangeBertalot (2004: 73).
Stauroneis subborealis Bahls (2010: 151–152). Valves are linear in small specimens to lanceolate in larger
specimens. Apices are protracted and broadly rounded. Length 46–142 µm, breadth 9–24 µm. Axial area
narrow, widening slightly near the central area. Stauros narrow, somewhat expanded toward the valve
margins. Raphe fissures lateral, proximal ends inflated and curved. Terminal raphe fissures hooked. Striae
radiate throughout, 17–20 in 10 µm. Areolae 18–22 in 10 µm. Stauroneis subborealis was described
elsewhere (Bahls 2010) from material collected at site 4526, IMRNA. Stauroneis subborealis has been found
in a few ponds, fens, and small lakes in western Montana, where it tolerates a wide range of pH and low to
moderate concentrations of electrolytes (Bahls 2010).
Stauroneis submarginalis Bahls (2010: 157–158). Valves are broadly lanceolate with slightly protracted,
broadly rounded apices. Length 140–186 µm, breadth 23–35 µm. A narrow line, visible in LM, runs parallel to
and 2–3 µm inside the valve margins. Axial area narrow, widening slightly near the central area. Stauros
narrow, rectangular, slightly expanded toward the valve margins and often containing short striae. Raphe
fissures lateral, proximal ends inflated and curved (not straight). Terminal raphe fissures hooked. Striae radiate
throughout, 15–17 in 10 µm. Areolae 16–20 in 10 µm. Stauroneis submarginalis was described elsewhere
(Bahls 2010) from material collected at site 4525, IMRNA. Stauroneis submarginalis has also been found in
several small lakes and wetlands in western Montana, northern Idaho, eastern Washington, and southern
Alberta, where it prefers circumneutral waters with very low concentrations of electrolytes (Bahls 2010).

Discussion
Global warming is shrinking the glaciers of nearby Glacier National Park (Fagre 2007), altering the hydrology
of the Northern Rockies (Rood et al. 2005), and threatening the integrity of peatlands worldwide (Dise 2009).
As a consequence, even protected fens such as those at IMRNA and the taxa they support are at risk, despite
the absence of land-based threats. For unprotected peatlands and other wetlands, draining and filling for
human settlement and agriculture continues to be a major threat to wetland species (Larsen 2002).
Germany and the northwestern United States have very similar diatom floras. Seventy-two percent of the
diatom taxa in the Northwest are found in Germany based on a comparison of checklists for the two regions
(Bahls 2009, Lange-Bertalot 1996). Both regions are within the Holarctic Kingdom of vascular plants
(Takhtajan 1986), which coincides more or less with the circumboreal distribution of many diatom species in
the Northern Hemisphere (e.g., see Medvedeva 2002, Metzeltin et al. 2009). Germany and the Northwest span
similar latitudes and have similar climates, and both have mountains, coastal areas, and inland waters with
very low to very high electrolyte content. For these reasons, and since there is no diatom “red list” for
Montana or the United States, the German list may serve as a surrogate list of imperiled diatoms for Montana
until such time as a more accurate list is prepared for this region.
“At risk” or “declining” ratings appear to be appropriate for the rare, northern, cold-loving fen diatoms at
Indian Meadows and elsewhere in Montana, especially in light of global warming and continued human
encroachment on wetlands. For most of these taxa, the closest records are hundreds or even thousands of
kilometers removed, mainly northward. Similar and potential habitats for these taxa are rare in Montana. The
two fens at IMRNA support two of only four Montana populations of the rare slenderleaf sundew (Drosera
linearis). The other two records are from fens in the Bob Marshall Wilderness about 40 km northwest of
IMRNA. The Bob Marshall fens have not been sampled for diatoms, but hold promise for supporting more
rare taxa and perhaps new species.
If the new Encyonema sp. from IMRNA proves to be the same taxon as the one reported by Krammer
(1997a) from Austria, it would be one of many diatom taxa from the European Alps to be reported in the
Northern Rockies. The diatom Distrionella incognita (Reichardt) Williams (1990: 176-177), originally
reported and known only from lakes in the foothills of the Alps, was recently found in the Northern Rockies,
primarily in large fjord-like lakes at lower elevations in Glacier National Park (Morales et al. 2005, Bahls
2007). A recently completed survey of diatom biodiversity in Glacier National Park (unpublished) has
uncovered many more northern/alpine taxa that are also found in Europe, giving floristic substance to a
common nickname for Glacier National Park: America’s Alps.
The new species from IMRNA and the many other rare species with widely disjunct distributions all raise
a perplexing question (Williams 1994): How did they get there? There are three possible answers to this
question. First, taxa that are new and unique to the fens at Indian Meadows may have evolved there from
precursors that already existed in the area, for example, Encyonema droseraphilum from E. silesiacum and
Stauroneis indianopsis from S. heinii. Endemism among diatoms is more common than previously thought
(Mann & Droop 1996) and ancient, stable ecosystems tend to produce large percentages of endemic species.
In Lake Baikal, it is estimated that endemic diatom species account for 30% (Kozhov 1963) to over 50%
(Skvortzov 1937) of the diatom flora. The fens at IMRNA are not nearly as old as Lake Baikal (they began
their succession at the end of the Pleistocene, about 10,000 years B.P.) but they are old enough to allow for
diatom speciation, as shown by the emergence of Stephanodiscus yellowstonensis Theriot & Stoermer (1984:
41) from a Stephanodiscus niagarae Ehrenberg (1845:80) precursor over just a few thousand years in
Yellowstone Lake (Theriot & Stoermer 1984, Theriot et al. 2006).
The second possible answer to the question of how they got there is that they have been there all along, or
at least since the continental and montane glaciers began to recede. At the end of the Pleistocene it is
estimated that 90% of the Northern Great Plains was under water or very wet, and areas that were not
submerged supported a boreal forest vegetation interspersed with muskeg (Pielou 1991). This was before the
region became drier and warm enough to support grasslands. Just west of the Great Plains, in the Northern

Rockies, recently scoured lake basins provided the physical container and a cool, wet climate provided the
right conditions for the development of peatlands. At that time, habitats for boreal diatoms that require cold,
oligotrophic, and circumneutral waters were much more abundant and more closely spaced than they are
today. Many of the meadows or grassy “parks” at lower elevations in the Northern Rockies began as small,
shallow lakes, which progressed to fens and wet meadows and finally to dry meadows. Local dispersal and
interchanges of peatland diatom taxa may have occurred at first, until most of the habitats dried up and the few
remaining populations became widely separated. This geographic separation of habitats and populations,
along with a local progression to more dystrophic conditions, may have driven the genetic divergence and
speciation noted above.
The final and least likely answer to the question of how they got there is recently, by dispersal and
ecological selection. Passive, long-range dispersal of viable diatom cells between distant freshwater habitats is
problematic and unproven (Harper 1999). Global history, including plate tectonics and glaciation, and the
distribution histories of individual diatom taxa and groups of taxa, are sufficient to explain the current
distributions of most diatoms (Kociolek & Spaulding 2000). Short-range dispersal from fen to fen, for
example in the fur of amphibious animals or on the feet of shorebirds, is more likely to occur. But even this is
problematic between widely separated fens.
The much larger number of diatom taxa in the abandoned beaver pond illustrates the intermediate
disturbance hypothesis, which holds that biodiversity is highest when disturbance is neither too rare nor too
frequent (Connell 1978, Grime 1973). For diatoms, Asai & Watanabe (2004) demonstrated that the maximum
number of species occurs at intermediate levels of organic enrichment; extremely high and extremely low
levels of organic pollution produce the smallest number of species. In the case of the beaver pond, the
disturbance is natural, mainly flooding, which results in a shift toward more minerotrophic and limnic
conditions. The IMRNA fens, on the other hand, represent undisturbed or rarely disturbed and increasingly
dystrophic habitats. In peatlands of northern Minnesota, Kingston (1982) demonstrated a decrease in diatom
species richness with a decrease in minerotrophy that accompanies peatland development. In another study of
an adjacent lake and fen in Labrador, Kingston (1984) found that the lake diatom assemblage was composed
mainly of small fragilarioid taxa, which he says are typical of post-glacial assemblages in north-temperate
lakes. We found several of these same small fragilarioid taxa in the abandoned beaver pond at IMRNA. The
Laborador fen, on the other hand, supported a substantially different diatom assemblage that was rich in
Eunotia Ehrenberg (1837: 44), Frustulia Rabenhorst 1853: 50), and Pinnularia Ehrenberg (1843: 45) species,
which is similar to the fen assemblages at Indian Meadows. The take home message from this is that
disturbance and pollution favor common species while the absence of disturbance and pollution favors
uncommon species.
In general, human activities tend to degrade water quality by increasing temperature, turbidity,
sedimentation, and concentrations of inorganic salts and nutrients. Natural cold, clear and fresh oligotrophic
and dystrophic waters are uncommon at temperate latitudes and are becoming more scarce with the advance
of human development. Oligotrophic and dystrophic waters support unique diatom assemblages that include
many new and rare species (e.g., Kulikovskiy et al. 2010, Lange-Bertalot & Metzeltin 1996). Most of the
imperiled diatoms on the Red List for Germany are oligotraphentic and their habitats in that country and
throughout much of central Europe are no longer available because of eutrophication from ubiquitous use of
fertilizers (Lange-Bertalot 1996, 1999b). Undisturbed, nutrient-poor waters are therefore worth protecting, for
the purpose of conserving rare species and for monitoring environmental change (Kociolek & Stoermer
2009). In the case of Indian Meadows, the United States Forest Service has designated the fens and their
watershed as a Research Natural Area (RNA), making it part of a national network of RNAs that protect
exemplary habitats on National Forest lands in perpetuity.
Despite their relative stability, peatlands are not immune to long-term change. At geologic time scales that
allow for speciation to occur, natural wetland succession will also result in the fens’ and their floras’ eventual
demise. As the fens progress toward wet meadows and eventually to dry meadows, more floristic changes will
occur, leading ultimately to diatom assemblages composed of aerophilic taxa. This process may proceed more

quickly with global warming, but with or without global warming, unless there is another glacial epoch to
scour new habitats and provide a starter climate for northern diatoms, the new and rare taxa described here
will become extinct or restricted to suitable surviving habitats much farther north.
