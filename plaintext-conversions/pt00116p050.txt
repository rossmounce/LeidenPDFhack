Abstract
Deprea zamorae Barboza & S. Leiva (Solanaceae), a new species from southern Ecuador (Loja and Zamora–Chinchipe),
is described and illustrated. It is most similar to D. cyanocarpa, but differs by the presence of minute teeth on the calyx,
the ratio of the corolla tube length to the lobe length, the orientation of the fruiting pedicels, and the color and shape of
the fruiting calyx. Its distribution does not overlap with that of any other Deprea species. A key for all Deprea species is
provided.
Key words: Endemism, Loja, pollen, taxonomy, seed, Zamora–Chinchipe

Introduction
Deprea Rafinesque (1838: 57) is a small neotropical genus from South America comprising eight species
(Garzón–Venegas & Orozco 2007). Based on morphological data, Hunziker (2001) placed the genus in the
tribe Solaneae subtribe Witheringiinae Reveal, while Sawyer (2005), based on a morphological phylogenetic
analysis, considered Deprea to be a member of the tribe Physalideae Miers. Recently, in agreement with
Sawyer, Olmstead et al. (2008) included Deprea in the tribe Physalideae, although the genus was not assigned
to any subtribe.
Morphologically, Deprea is considered close to Larnax Miers (1849: 37) (Barboza & Hunziker 1994,
Sawyer 1998, 2005, Hunziker 2001, Garzón–Venegas & Orozco 2006). Sawyer (2005) redefined Deprea as a
monophyletic group excluding D. glabra (Standley 1935: 32) Hunziker (1977: 25) and D. sylvarum (Standley
& C.V. Morton 1938: 1036) Hunziker (1977: 25), which he transferred to Larnax (Sawyer 2001), and
proposed Brachistus Miers (1849: 262) as its sister group. Deprea species are shrubs with showy colored
flowers. The corolla is funnel-shaped in the majority of the species, with lobes shorter than the tube or rarely
as long as the tube. The stamens are equal, with the basal end of the filament slightly expanded, not thickened,
and fused to the corolla tube forming the so–called stapet. The fruiting calyx is accrescent, tightly or loosely
enveloping the berry. Deprea species grow mostly in humid Andean forests from Colombia to northern Peru and
also in central Bolivia, except D. ecuatoriana Hunziker & Barboza (1996: 109) which inhabits drier areas with low
vegetation in the paramos of Ecuador and Peru (Sawyer 1999).
Recently, due to explorations in previously inaccessable regions of the Andes, several new species have
been described (Leiva et al. 2005, Sawyer 2007, Garzón–Venegas & Orozco 2007). In recent field trips (2011–
2012) to southern Ecuador (Loja and Zamora –Chinchipe), a peculiar Deprea species was found whose
flowering and fruiting features were different from any other species of this genus. It is described here as a

new species; a key to differentiate it from its congeners is also provided. Along with the description, pollen
and seed information is provided.

Material and Methods
Taxonomy:—The description is based on measurements of living plants taken during field work in Prov.
Zamora–Chinchipe and examination of herbarium specimens loaned from or studied at the AAU, COL, CORD,
F, HAO, MO, NY, QCA, QCNE, S, and U herbaria. Field observations and morphological examinations were
conducted using a stereomicroscope with dried material or specimens preserved in FAA solution or 70%
alcohol. Measurements of dried material were made from dissections of flowers rehydrated in hot water.
Information about flower, fruit, and seed color was taken mainly from our own observations in the field. The
morphology of the trichomes was analyzed with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a a digital camera.
The map indicates the distribution of the new species as well as the other species of Deprea. The conservation
status proposed here follows the Red List Categories and Criteria, version 12.1 (IUCN 2012).
Pollen and seeds:—Pollen was obtained from dry anthers of herbarium specimens or fresh anthers fixed
in FAA in the field. Samples for light microscope observations were mounted in glycerin. For scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), non–acetolysed grains were mounted on an SEM stub in a few drops of 70%
alcohol and allowed to dry. Samples were coated with gold/palladium and examined using a JEOL JSM 35 CF
SEM (LABMEM, National University of San Luis, Argentina). Measurements are based on 15 pollen grains
from 5 collections (marked with an asterisk in Additional specimens examined), including the type specimens.
Descriptive terminology follows Punt et al. (2007) and Hesse et al. (2009).
Seeds were processed according to Lester & Durrands (1984) for SEM. In brief, seeds were soaked in
distilled water for 1 h, rinsed 3 times in distilled water and then in 5–10% commercial bleach for 15 minutes.
The seeds were then washed twice and treated with a driaselase enzyme solution (driaselase 0.5% in
Sorenson’s phosphate buffer). The seeds were incubated in the enzyme solution for 48 hs at 30ºC under
discontinuous agitation, washed with distilled water and air dried, and coated with gold/palladium.

Taxonomic Treatment
Deprea zamorae Barboza & S. Leiva, sp. nov. (Fig. 1, 2 A–D, 3, 4).
Type:—ECUADOR. Zamora–Chinchipe: Límite del PN Podocarpus, desvío de la ruta principal en el límite entre Prov.
Zamora–Chinchipe/Loja, a 600 m del desvío, 2750 m, 15 November 2011 (fl, fr), C. I. Orozco, G. Barboza, S. Leiva
& A. Orejuela 3926 (holotype COL!, isotypes COL!, CORD 00006744!, CORD 00006745!, HAO!, QCA!).
Deprea zamorae can be distinguished from other Deprea species by the purple indumentum and purple color of the
young branches and leaves, the narrowly campanulate corolla with the tube as long as or slightly longer than the
lobes, and the urceolate orange or reddish orange accrescent calyx with minute teeth that tightly invests the berry.

Shrubs (0.5–)1.5–3 m high, much branched; older stems green, terete, hollow, glabrous, longitudinally ridged,
2–2.3 cm diameter at the base; young stems green with purple nodes, densely covered by simple nonglandular transparent trichomes, the trichomes intense purple at the tips of the branches; sympodial units
unifoliate. Leaves alternate and in branch forks; blades (5–)7–8(–9.5) cm long, 3–5 cm wide, elliptic, slightly
fleshy, dark green with purple–lilac colored veins beneath, densely pubescent on both surfaces, mainly on the
abaxial surface, with patent simple or occasionally branched trichomes on the veins, the margin entire, repand,
the apex acuminate, the base attenuate and unequal; petioles 1–1.5 cm long, purple with transparent patent
indumentum. Secondary veins 6–8 pairs, impressed on the adaxial surface and prominent on the abaxial
surface, forming a strong reticulum with other minor veins. Inflorescence axillary, usually 2 or 3(–5) flowered, the flowers opening asynchronously; flowering pedicels pendent, widening slightly distally, 11–17
mm long, densely pubescent, the hairs transparent or purple and patent; buds ovoid, purplish green. Calyx

margins; tube swollen, 5–6.5 mm long, 5–6.1 mm wide, with a ring of relatively short non-glandular
trichomes half way to the base inside and with the same tube indumentum outside. Filaments cream basally
and purple distally, glabrous, equal or subequal, (3–)3.9–4.5 mm; anthers exserted, oblong, purple, ca. (2–
)2.5–2.7 mm long, 1.9–2 mm wide, the connective cream; filament base expansion cream, 1.5–2 mm long.
Ovary glaucous, pyriform, slightly 5-angled, ca. 1.5–1.8 mm long, 1.5–1.7 mm wide, the nectary yellowish
cream, inconspicuous; style exerted, cream or sometimes lilac, glabrous, 5.3–6.6 mm, widening distally;
stigma dark green, capitate, somewhat bilobed, 0.8–1 mm diameter. Berry ovoid or slightly globose, flattened
at the apex, (8–)10–11 mm long, 9–11(–13) mm diameter, orange or reddish orange at maturity; stone cells
12–15 per fruit, yellowish white; fruiting pedicels pendent, the fruiting calyx accrescent, urceolate, orange or

to reniform, compressed, yellowish brown, 1.5–1.7 mm long, 1.5–1.6 mm wide; testa reticulate.
Etymology:—The name refers to the distribution of the species in southern Ecuador in ZamoraChinchipe Province.
Phenology:— Flowering and fruiting from April to November.
Distribution and Habitat:—Endemic to southern Ecuador (Prov. Loja and Zamora–Chinchipe, Fig. 3)
between 2200–2900 m in fragments of primary wet montane forests. It grows in black, clayey, and rich soils
in association with Baccharis (Asteraceae), Brachyotum (Melastomataceae), Rubus (Rosaceae), Weinmannia
(Cunoniaceae), Puya (Bromeliaceae), Chusquea (Poaceae), Cortaderia (Poaceae), among others. It is usually
found along roadsides and on steep slopes.
Conservation Status:—The conservation status of this species would be vulnerable (VU) under criteria
B2 (a, b), known at 7 locations and the extent of occurrence below 2,000 km2 (IUCN Red List Criteria 2012).
Anatomical observations:—Deprea zamorae has purple and whitish cream simple glandular and
verrucose simple and branched non–glandular trichomes. Long simple eglandular trichomes cover the
vegetative organs, pedicels, calyx, and corolla; they consist of (2–)4–9 elongate cells, the distal cell acute
(Fig. 4 A). Branched trichomes are very rare on mature stems and leaves; they appear occasionally in young
leaves and inside the corolla (Fig. 4B). Papillae (Fig. 4C) and very short trichomes, some of them branched,
are present on the calyx and apex and margins of the corolla lobes while trichomes of 3–8 rectangular to
isodiametric cells, the distal one obtuse, cover the basal ½ length of the corolla tube interior (Fig. 4D).
Glandular trichomes can be short or long; the former have a unicellular stalk and a globose multicellular head
(Fig. 4E). These are common on both leaf surfaces and on the adaxial calyx surface, and less frequent on the
corolla. The second type of glandular trichome has a 3–5-celled stalk and a unicellular oblong head (Fig. 4F);
these occur on most of the outer corolla surface and sometimes also on the calyx and pedicels.
Pollen grains are small sized (polar diameter 23.012 ± 0.846 m), spheroidal in outline in hydrated
condition, and tricolporate (Fig. 4G). The pollen surface is irregular (Fig. 4G, I). The exine ornamentation is
sparsely microechinate (7.643 ± 0.802 microechini per m2), and the aperture membrane is granular (Fig. 4G, I).
Seeds are ovoid to reniform, compressed, 2.8 ± 0.2 mm long × 2.5 ± 0.2 mm wide (Fig. 4H). Seed coat
sculpture is reticulate (Fig. 4H). The cells are polygonal with almost straight lateral walls in the seed margin,
and irregular in shape with sinuate lateral walls in the center of the seed (Fig. 4H, J). All the cell walls, except
for the outer periclinal walls, are papillate (Fig. 4J, K); pits are present mainly at the base of the anticlinal cell
walls (Fig. 4K).

Discussion
Deprea zamorae is unique in the genus by its combination of the showy purple color of young branches and
leaves (Fig. 2 A, B), the corolla shape and color (Fig. 2 C), the color and shape of the fruiting calyx (Fig. 2 D),
and the type of trichomes. The corolla is narrowly campanulate with the tube as long as or slightly longer than
the lobes (Fig. 2 C). The orange or reddish orange accrescent calyx tightly investing the berry with minute
teeth at the apex is unusual in the genus (Fig. 2 D). Branched hairs (Fig. 4 B) have been thus far known only
in D. orinocensis (Kunth in Humboldt et al. 1818: 12) Rafinesque (1838: 57) (Sawyer & Benítez de Rojas
1998), but D. zamorae has some scattered branched hairs on the stems, leaves, and inner corolla surface.
Deprea zamorae resembles D. cyanocarpa J. Garzón & C.I. Orozco (2007: 220), an endemic species from
Colombia, in its narrowly campanulate corolla of similar size and the purple trichomes of the calyx and
corolla (Fig. 2 E). Deprea zamorae differs from D. cyanocarpa mainly by the presence of minute teeth on the
calyx instead of longer calyx lobes (0.3–0.6 mm long vs. 1–2.5 mm long), the ratio of the corolla tube length
to the lobe length (tube as long as or slightly longer than the lobes vs. tube two times longer than the lobes),
the orientation of the fruiting pedicels (pendent vs. erect), the fruiting calyx color and shape (orange or
reddish orange, urceolate, not invaginated at the base, slightly 5–10-costate and tightly enveloping the berry
vs. purple, pyriform, invaginated at the base, strongly 5-costate and loosely enveloping the berry). No Deprea
species are sympatric with D. zamorae. The geographically closest species is D. cuyacensis (N.W. Sawyer &
S. Leiva in Sawyer 2001: 462) S. Leiva & Lezama (in Leiva et al. 2005: 63), from northern Peru and southern
Ecuador, differing mainly by its scarce indumentum on the vegetative organs, its pale violet and funnelshaped corolla, and its white with purple veins fruiting calyx that loosely invests the berry.
The pollen has been described as rugulate or rugulate–reticulate in most Deprea species, except for the
scabrate pollen in D. cuyacensis (Sawyer 1999). However, from the images shown in that publication, the
pollen surface surface appears irregular, similar to D. zamorae, instead of rugulate and rugulate-reticulate (cf.
Hesse et al. 2009). The microechini (pointed ornamentations smaller than 1 µ m; cf. Hesse et al. 2009)
observed in D. zamorae have not been mentioned in other Deprea species. Since new detailed descriptions for
each Deprea species are needed to standardize the terminology and make them comparable, a palynological
analysis of the genus is in progress.
The seeds of D. zamorae fit the overall generic description (Barboza & Hunziker 1994; Hunziker 2001);
the seed coat micromorphologycal features of Deprea zamorae are the first records on the subject for the
genus.
