Abstract
A phylogenetic analysis based on nuclear ITS and plastid trnK intron sequences confirms that Dahlgrenodendron,
Sinopora, Triadodaphne, and Yasunia are members of the Cryptocarya group, as expected from morphology.
Dahlgrenodendron from South Africa is sister to Aspidostemon from Madagascar. Triadodaphne inaequitepala is nested
within Endiandra (both from Australasia), and Yasunia from South America is nested among South American
Beilschmiedia species. Sinopora is a member of the Beilschmiedia clade, but its precise position is still uncertain.
Among large genera of the group, Cryptocarya is clearly monophyletic, and Endiandra appears to be as well, if
T. inaequitepala is included. Beilschmiedia is paraphyletic with respect to (at least) Potameia and Yasunia. Most wellsupported clades within genera are geographically homogeneous, except a clade including the Chilean Cryptocarya alba
and two New Caledonian species. Both Beilschmiedia and Cryptocarya have reached the Americas more than once.
Four-locular anthers are plesiomorphic in the Cryptocarya group; two-locular anthers have arisen by fusion of the two
pollen sacs of a theca. In the plesiomorphic fruit type, the ovary is completely enclosed in receptacular tissue; a superior
fruit, seated free on its pedicel, is a synapomorphy of the Beilschmiedia clade.
Key words: Biogeography, evolution, floral morphology

Introduction
Lauraceae are among the larger families of Magnoliidae and one of the most common families in moist tropical and
subtropical forests of the Americas, Asia, and Australia (Gentry 1988). As discussed in more detail by Rohwer
(1993) and van der Werff & Richter (1996), morphology-based systems of the family have been divergent,
depending on the relative importance attributed to characters by different authors. Molecular studies, in contrast,
have been largely congruent and thus have led to a widespread agreement about the major phylogenetic divisions
(Rohwer 2000; Chanderbali et. al. 2001; Rohwer & Rudolph 2005). In these studies, the Cryptocarya group,
which had first been recognized based on wood and bark anatomy by Richter (1981), turned out to be sister to the
rest of the family except Hypodaphnis Stapf (1909). The group has been shown to include at least the genera
Beilschmiedia Nees (1831: 61, 69), Cryptocarya Brown (1810: 402), Endiandra Brown (1810: 402), Aspidostemon
Rohwer & Richter (1987: 71), Potameia Du Petit-Thouars (1806: 5), Eusideroxylon Teijsmann & Binnendijk
(1863: 292), and Potoxylon Kostermans (1978: 143). Beilschmiedia and Cryptocarya are species-rich genera,
widespread in tropical and subtropical regions of all continents, though estimates of 250 and 350 spp., respectively,
by Rohwer (1993) may be too high. Endiandra (ca. 100 spp.) is distributed from the Malesian region through
eastern Australia to the western Pacific islands. Potameia (ca. 25 spp.) has most of its species in Madagascar but
has also been reported from India to Southeast Asia, where delimitation from Syndiclis Hooker (1886a: pl. 1515)

(ca. 10 spp.) is not entirely clear. Aspidostemon (28 spp., van der Werff 2006) is a Malagasy endemic, whereas
Eusideroxylon and Potoxylon are monotypic endemics of the Greater Sunda Islands.
Based on morphology, Aspidostemon, Eusideroxylon, Potoxylon and Cryptocarya (including Ravensara
Sonnerat [1782: 226, plate 127], see van der Werff 1992) appear to be well defined, even though the diversity
within Cryptocarya led Rohwer (1993) to append the statement “In need of a comprehensive revision, perhaps not
monophyletic” to his description. Delimitation of the remaining genera is less straightforward, as has been
discussed by Hyland (1989) and van der Werff & Nishida (2010).
Several minor genera of Lauraceae remained unstudied with molecular methods so far, due to lack of suitable
material: Brassiodendron Allen (1942: 153), Cinnadenia Kostermans (1973: 223), Dahlgrenodendron van der
Merwe & van Wyk in van der Merwe et al. (1988: 80), Dodecadenia Nees (1831: 61, 63), Gamanthera van der
Werff & Endress (1991: 401), Hexapora Hooker (1886b: 189), Phyllostemonodaphne Kostermans (1936: 754),
Syndiclis, Triadodaphne Kostermans (1974a: 119); others have been described after the molecular studies cited
above were published: Sinopora J. Li, N.H. Xia & H.W. Li (2008: 199), Yasunia van der Werff & Nishida (2010:
494). Among these, Triadodaphne had been placed in the Cryptocarya group based on wood anatomical evidence
by Richter (1981) or even in synonymy of Endiandra by Rohwer (1993) based on morphology. Rohwer (1993)
also placed Cassytha, Dahlgrenodendron, and Hypodaphnis in the Cryptocarya group based on fruits in which the
ovary is completely surrounded by receptacular tissue. Molecular studies have later shown that Cassytha does not
belong to this clade and that Hypodaphnis is sister to all other Lauraceae (Rohwer 2000; Chanderbali et. al. 2001;
Rohwer & Rudolph 2005). Rohwer (1993) placed Brassiodendron, Hexapora and Syndiclis (the latter as a
synonym of Potameia) in his Beilschmiedia group, which is now part of the Cryptocarya group according to the
molecular studies cited above. Gamanthera and Phyllostemonodaphne were placed in the Aniba subgroup of the
Ocotea group by Rohwer (1993), whereas Dodecadenia was placed in Laureae. Cinnadenia was left as incertae
sedis. Placement of Dodecadenia was confirmed by a molecular analysis of Li et al. (2004), but the others are still
awaiting study.
Recently, suitable material has become available of Dahlgrenodendron, Sinopora, and Yasunia, and we
managed to extract DNA from an older collection of Triadodaphne inaequitepala (Kostermans 1969: 485)
Kostermans (1993: 131). Based on sequences of the plastid trnK intron (including the matK gene) and the internal
transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrITS), we therefore attempt to answer the following
questions. (1) Are Dahlgrenodendron, Sinopora, and Yasunia really members of the Cryptocarya group, as has
been expected from morphology? (2) Is Triadodaphne inaequitepala a species of Endiandra, as suggested by van
der Werff (2001)? (3) Are the large genera Beilschmiedia, Cryptocarya and Endiandra monophyletic? In addition,
we discuss evolution of some key characters in Lauraceae and some disjunctions within the Cryptocarya group.

Materials and Methods
Taxon sampling and choice of outgroup.—Samples of plant material were obtained from sources listed in Table 1.
In each case, correctness or at least plausibility of the determination was verified, as far as that was possible, often in
the absence of recent monographs. BLAST searches showed that all trnK intron sequences of the newly investigated
genera were most similar to members of the Cryptocarya group in the sense of Rohwer (2000) or Cryptocaryeae in
the sense of Chanderbali et al. (2001). In the case of the widespread genera Beilschmiedia and Cryptocarya, care
was taken to include samples from different parts of their range. Based on results of previous molecular studies
(Rohwer 2000; Chanderbali et al. 2001; Rohwer & Rudolph 2005), Hypodaphnis zenkeri (Engler 1899: 385) Stapf
(1909: 185) was chosen as outgroup for all analyses. In total, we examined 139 collections of 92 species. In the
phylogenetic analysis, however, the number of terminal taxa was reduced to 64, for reasons outlined below.
Molecular methods.—The methods of DNA extraction and amplification have been described in detail by
Rohwer & Rudolph (2005) for the trnK intron and by Rohwer et al. (2009) for the ITS region. These protocols
were modified and adjusted to the 3500 Genetic Analyzer sequencing system (Applied Biosystems) as follows. In
addition to the primers used in those studies, we designed a new one for each of the sequence regions. The new
trnK intron primer v510-R (5’-CRA TCA CTC TTT TGA CTT TGG-3’) aligns approximately 510 bp downstream
from the universal primer 3914-F of Steele & Vilgalys (1994) or about 80 bp downstream from a poly-T region
present in almost all Lauraceae. The new primer ITS-H-R (5’-CGG TTC GCT CGC CGT TAC TA-3’) was

designed after we found that the primer ITS-26-R of Käss & Wink (1997) has three mismatches for most members
of the Cryptocarya group. The 5’-end of the new primer overlaps by 10 bp with the 3’-end of the ITS-26 primer.
The PCR products were purified either using spin columns of the Montage PCR Filter Units (Millipore) or by
degradation of single stranded DNA and proteins with FastAP™ thermosensitive alkaline phosphatase and
exonuclease I (Thermo Scientific), both according to manufacturers’ instructions. Depending on the amount of
pure PCR product, 1:2 to 1:20 dilutions of the PCR product were used for sequencing. The sequencing reactions of
the trnK intron and ITS region were carried out as described in Rohwer & Rudolph (2005) and Rohwer et al.
(2009), respectively. The 10 µL sequencing products were precipitated in a mix of 1 µL 125 mM EDTA, 1 µL 3 M
sodium acetate, and 25 µL ethanol absolute at room temperature for 20 min, with subsequent centrifugation at
13,000 rpm (ca. 16,600 g) and 4° C for 1 h. The pellet was washed in 35 µL 76% cold ethanol, dried and
resuspended in 20 µL HiDi formamide for sequencing analysis using a 3500 Genetic Analyzer capillary sequencer
(Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
The ITS and trnK intron sequences of each taxon were confirmed by forward and reverse sequencing reactions,
except in a few cases where we had already several confirmed sequences from the same taxon or closely related
taxa, so that sequencing in one direction appeared sufficient.
Sequence alignment.—The sequence fragments of each taxon were first edited individually, then aligned
automatically using SequencherTM (GeneCodes), and subsequently checked manually in order to remove any
uncertainties. The edited sequences (132 new sequences from this study) have been deposited in EMBL under the
accession numbers indicated in Table 1. Sequences in which the accession number starts with HG31 (i.e., all ITS
sequences and most trnK intron sequences) have been prepared for this study, whereas those starting with AJ247
and AJ627 are from an earlier study (Rohwer & Rudolph 2005).

Sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE alignment as implemented in MEGA 5 (Tamura et al. 2011),
using the default parameters. After automatic alignment, we made some manual adjustments guided by the
following principles. 1. If an indel can be explained by a duplication of an immediately adjacent DNA motive,
then this is the preferred position. 2. If indels of the same size occur in different taxa in close proximity, then it is
more likely that the indel originated once than that it originated several times (unless the adjacent bases suggest the
contrary, as outlined in principle 1). 3. If different equally plausible alignments would lead to different (possibly
spurious) synapomorphies, and it cannot be decided which one is preferable based on overall similarity of the

sequences, then an uninformative placement of the indel is preferred. If such a placement is not possible, then the
indel positions are excluded from the analysis. In general, simple indel coding following Simmons & Ochoterena
(2000; see also Simmons et al. 2007) was applied to those informative indels that could be placed with confidence.
In a few cases, however, where short insertions of different size and/or different sequence suggesting a possibly
different origin have been found in the same position relative to the majority of the taxa or where indels were
caused by single nucleotide repeats of different lengths, we preferred to use a single multistate character.
Uninformative indels and areas of uncertain alignment (which occurred only in the ITS sequences) were excluded
from the analysis. If uncertainties in the alignment involved only a few taxa, then the sequence positions of
uncertain alignment were replaced by question marks in these taxa only. In the final analysis, we included only
those taxa from which we were able to obtain complete, clean sequences of both the ITS region and the trnK intron.
As a rule the two sequences were obtained from the same sample, except Beilschmiedia tawa, Cryptocarya alba,
and Hypodaphnis zenkeri. In these species, a trnK intron sequence had been submitted to GenBank earlier,
whereas the ITS region was sequenced here from a different collection. The final alignment is found in the
supplementary data.
Phylogenetic analyses.—Data analyses employed maximum parsimony (MP) using PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford
2003), maximum likelihood (ML) using Treefinder (Jobb 2008), and Bayesian inference (BI) using MrBayes 3.1.2
(Huelsenbeck & Ronquist 2001, Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). The data from the trnK intron and ITS were
analyzed separately as well as combined in a single analysis after the separate analyses had shown that their results
were largely compatible (but not entirely, see below). If two or more sequences obtained from different collections
of the same taxon turned out to be identical in all non-excluded positions, only one of them was used for the final
analysis.
In the MP analysis, a heuristic search was performed with 100 random addition sequence replicates, tree
bisection-reconnection (TBR) swapping, collapse of zero-length branches, and MulTrees on. All character state
changes were equally weighted, and those gaps that had not been excluded were treated as missing data. Branch
support was estimated by fast bootstrapping (Mort et al. 2000) with 100,000 replicates.
For Bayesian inference, data were divided into a total of eight unlinked partitions. Five partitions were used
for the trnK intron data, one for the indels, one for the non-coding intron regions, and one for each of the three
codon-positions of the matK gene. Three partitions were applied to the ITS data, one for the positions coding for
ribosomal RNA (mainly the 5.8S region, plus small parts of the 18S and 26S regions), one for the non-coding ITS1 and ITS-2 regions, and one for the indels. The most appropriate substitution models for the partitions including
DNA data were estimated by MrModelTest (Nylander 2004) using MrMTgui (Nuin 2005). As suggested in the
MrBayes manual, the default priors with Dirichlet proposal were used for the analysis. For each analysis, two
simultaneous runs of four MCMC chains each were run for 5,000,000 generations, with the current tree saved
every 500 generations. The burnin was determined by visual inspection of the likelihood values in Excel, and the
posterior probabilities for the individual clades were computed by creating a majority-rule consensus of the
remaining trees in PAUP.
In the ML analysis, the indel matrix could not be used, but for the DNA data the same six partitions were used
as for the BI analysis. The substitution models were calculated independently for each partition using the “propose
model” option as implemented in Treefinder. Branch support was estimated by partition-wise likelihood bootstrap
with 1,000 replicates.

Results
Sequence characteristics.—The alignment of the 64 trnK sequences was straightforward. The alignment length
used for the analysis was 2,606 bp, of which 125 were excluded from the analysis (all of them uniformative indels).
In addition, we coded 21 potentially parsimony informative indels. Among the 2,481 included alignment positions
in the trnK intron dataset, 2,094 were constant, 203 variable but not parsimony-informative, and 205 were
potentially parsimony-informative. Including the 21 informative indels, the total number of informative characters
was 226.
In the case of ITS, only the coding parts (18S, 5.8S and 26S) could be aligned without any ambiguity. In the
non-coding parts (ITS-1 and ITS-2), the use of different algorithms and different parameters led to (sometimes

substantial) differences in the alignment, mainly because a few taxa (Aspidostemon, Dahlgrenodendron,
Eusideroxylon, Hypodaphnis, and Potoxylon) differed considerably from the other included taxa and among
themselves. The alignment in Beilschmiedia, Cryptocarya, Endiandra, Potameia, Sinopora, Triadodaphne, and
Yasunia, on the other hand, was not problematic, except for few positions. Therefore, we replaced the alignment
positions (nucleotides and indels) that could not be readily aligned in Aspidostemon (272), Dahlgrenodendron
(154), Eusideroxylon (139), Hypodaphnis (223), and Potoxylon (125) by question marks (number of replaced
positions in parentheses, nearly all of them in regions rich in indels). The data matrix that we finally used
comprised 855 aligned positions plus 32 coded parsimony informative indels. A total of 132 positions were
excluded from the analyses, most of them uninformative indels, but also a few positions of uncertain alignment.
Among the 755 included alignment positions in the ITS dataset, 352 were constant, 105 variable but not
parsimony-informative, and 266 were potentially parsimony-informative. In addition, 32 informative indels have
been coded, so that the total number of informative characters was 298.
Phylogenetic analyses.—Statistics for the maximum parsimony analyses can be found in Table 2. The fast
bootstrap trees from maximum parsimony analyses (not shown) were invariably much less resolved than the trees
retrieved from the Bayesian analyses (Figs. 1–3), and only a single clade with marginal support was found to be
conflicting with the result from the respective Bayesian analysis (Endiandra glauca and E. impressicosta get 53 and
54% BS as sister taxa in the maximum parsimony analyses of the ITS and the combined data sets, whereas
Triadodaphne inaequitepala is supported as sister to E. impressicosta in the Bayesian analyses, with 0.95 PP in both
data sets). There were, however, a few conflicts between the results from the trnK intron data and the ITS data.
Therefore, the results of the Bayesian analyses are shown here separately (Figs. 1–3). The results of the maximum
likelihood analyses were generally similar to those of the Bayesian analyses, but less resolved. There were several
conflicting clades, especially in the result from the trnK dataset, but none of them with more than 75% BS.

Among a total of 73 clades of different composition retrieved in all nine analyses, 23 are invariably present,
and another 21 are compatible with all supported clades from all analyses. Among the 29 clades that were found to
be conflicting with at least one other clade of at least one of the other analyses, there are only two “hard” conflicts,
i.e. cases in which a well-supported clade (PP ≥0.95 or BS ≥90%) in one analysis conflicts with a well-supported
clade in another analysis (clade 27 and clade 59 vs. clade 62). This conflict is due to a different placement of
Beilschmiedia oreophila in the plastid trnK and the nuclear ITS data (described below).
The well-supported clade (clade 1) sister to the rest of the ingroup (clade 2) consists of Eusideroxylon zwageri
and Potoxylon melagangai. Its sister (clade 2), comprising all other taxa, has slightly lower support. Within clade
2, Aspidostemon parvifolium and Dahlgrenodendron natalense (clade 3) are sister to the remaining taxa (clade 4).
The next split in clade 4 is between the genus Cryptocarya (clade 5) and all other taxa (clade 6, in the following
called the Beilschmiedia clade). Within Cryptocarya (clade 5), all analyses show a split between Cryptocarya
alba, C. oubatchensis and C. pluricostata (clade 7) and all other species (clade 8). The differences among the
various analyses begin above this point. Therefore, we describe in detail the result of the Bayesian analysis of the
combined matrix (Fig. 1) and differences compared to the other analyses. Clades supported (mainly) by one of the

data sets (trnK or ITS) are usually compatible with the result of the other data set as well, unless otherwise stated.
Within clade 7, the Bayesian analysis of the combined matrix (Fig. 1) shows Cryptocarya alba as sister to clade 9,
which consists of C. oubatchensis and C. pluricostata and receives only low support. This topology is also
retrieved by MP in the ITS data set, but it conflicts with the result from trnK and the ML analysis of the ITS data.
Clade 8 (the rest of Cryptocarya) is shown as two groups, of which one (clade 10) consists of the majority of the
Old World and Pacific Cryptocarya species (C. angulata, C. bidwillii, C. concinna, C. densiflora, C. gracilis,
C. guillauminii, C. mannii, C. oahuensis, C. triplinervis), whereas its sister group (clade 11) consists of all
Brazilian Cryptocarya species investigated (C. aff. aschersoniana, C. botelhensis, C. citriformis, C. mandioccana,
C. moschata, C. saligna, C. wiedensis), plus the two Malagasy species, C. subtriplinervia and Ravensara elliptica.
Both clades (10 and 11) have moderate to strong support only in the Bayesian analyses. The next divergence
within clade 10 is between Cryptocarya angulata, C. densiflora, C. gracilis, and C. guillauminii (clade 12), and
C. bidwillii, C. concinna, C. mannii, C. oahuensis, and C. triplinervis (clade 13). Both clades receive more support
from the trnK data than from the ITS data. Within clade 12, the topology differs somewhat between the BI and the
ML analyses. Within clade 13 Cryptocarya bidwillii and C. triplinervis form a strongly supported species pair
(clade 16) sister to the remaining species (clade 17), which are supported as monophyletic by the ITS analysis only.
Also the sister group relationship of the two Hawaiian species, C. mannii and C. oahuensis (clade 18) gets its
strong support from ITS. Within clade 11, the Brazilian species (Cryptocarya aff. aschersoniana, C. botelhensis,
C. citriformis, C. mandioccana, C. moschata, C. saligna, and C. wiedensis, clade 19) are sister to the Malagasy
species (Cryptocarya subtriplinervia and Ravensara elliptica, clade 20). The Malagasy clade is strongly supported
in all analyses, whereas the Brazilian clade gets its support from ITS.
In the other major part of the ingroup, the Beilschmiedia group (clade 6), resolution at the base is usually poor,
and/or most of the basal clades are poorly supported (e.g., clades 26 and 27, Fig. 1). There are, however, numerous
less comprehensive clades that get considerable support, are invariably present, or are at least compatible with
results of all analyses. Clade 28, including three Central American species (Beilschmiedia alloiophylla,
B. costaricensis, and B. immersinervis) plus Sinopora hongkongensis from China, is supported only in the
Bayesian ITS analyses but not by other algorithms or in analyses of trnK or combined data. Sinopora
hongkongensis is shown as sister to the remaining species (clade 32), which are supported in all analyses. Clade 29
is supported by all data sets, at least with BI. It includes all South American Beilschmiedia species investigated
and Yasunia, which is from South America as well. Within this clade, the two Chilean species, B. berteroana and
B. miersii (clade 34), are always sister to the other four species (clade 35). Clade 35 is supported by all data sets, at
least with BI. If it is present in the MP and ML analyses, then also its internal topology is the same as in the
Bayesian analyses. Clade 30 is compatible with the results of all analyses and includes two Central American
species, B. brenesii and B. mexicana, as well as five Asian species, viz. B. dictyoneura, B. roxburghiana, and three
undetermined species collected by one of us (HvdW) in Vietnam. However, it gets weak support only in the
combined BI analysis. The close relationship of the Central American species (clade 38) is supported by all data
sets, but only in results from the combined data set are they sister to the Asian species (clade 39). In the combined
BI analysis, the African and Malagasy Beilschmiedia species plus the (mainly) Malagasy genus Potameia form a
weakly supported clade (31), which conflicts with the trnK ML analysis, in which the two African species are sister
to the rest of the Beilschmiedia clade. Within clade 31, the Malagasy taxa (B. madagascariensis, B. velutina and
the two Potameia spp. (clade 43) are sister to the African taxa, B. pierreana and B. sp. (Breteler 5283; clade 44).
The Malagasy clade (43) is only present in the trnK tree, which conflicts with the Bayesian ITS tree. Within clade
43, the two Beilschmiedia species (clade 45) are sister to the two Potameia species (clade 46). Both clades have
support from ITS, whereas the African clade (44) is always strongly supported.
Among the remaining species (from Australia, New Zealand, New Guinea, and New Caledonia, clade 27),
mainly Beilschmiedia oreophila is found in different positions in some analyses. Most other clades are congruent
or at least compatible among the various analyses. Clade 48, consisting of B. recurva, B. tooram, and B. volckii
from Australia plus B. tarairi from New Zealand, is supported by trnK only. The other two taxa from New
Zealand, B. tawa and B. tawaroa (clade 49), are identical in both ITS and trnK sequences. Clade 50, including all
Endiandra spp. as well as Triadodaphne inaequitepala, is supported by all data sets, at least under BI, although
significantly only by trnK. Within clade 50, the New Caledonian E. baillonii, E. lecardii, and E. poueboensis
(strongly supported) are sister to the remaining species (clade 52). Within it, E. pubens is sister to the other three
species, which are retrieved (clade 54) in all analyses. The precise topology within clade 54 varies, however,
among analyses.

Maximum likelihood analyses.—Results of the combined ML analysis (Fig. 4) recover almost the same
topology as BI within the genus Cryptocarya except clade 9 is collapsed. The Beilschmiedia clade (6) is much less
resolved, and it shows a weakly supported new clade (65) consisting of B. tarairi in addition to B. tooram and B.
volckii (clade 57). In results of the ML trnK analysis (not shown) seven clades are found that have not been
retrieved with other methods of analysis. All of them are weakly supported and conflict with most other results,
including combined BI results. Results of the ML ITS-only analysis are still less resolved.

Discussion
Reliability of the data.—The usefulness of the plastid trnK intron (including matK) for phylogenetic inference has
been shown in numerous studies on different levels from the angiosperms as a whole (Hilu et al. 2003 and
references therein) to relationships between genera in the Lauraceae (Rohwer 2000; Rohwer & Rudolph 2005).
Within genera, however, its informative value reaches its limit because there are often few or no differences
between closely related taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA has also been
widely used in many systematic studies, including Lauraceae (Chanderbali et al. 2001; Chanderbali 2004; Li et al.
2004; Rohwer et al. 2009). This marker is much more variable than the trnK intron but is difficult to align among
more distantly related taxa. Combining trnK and ITS increases resolution as expected, but most of the lower nodes
within the Beilschmiedia branch are still weakly supported in the Bayesian analysis and unresolved in the MP and
ML analyses. Thus, conflicts between results of the trnK and the ITS analyses appear to be due to homoplasy,
rather than to different evolutionary histories of the plastid and the nuclear genomes. Even Beilschmiedia
oreophila, the only species involved in a well-supported conflict in our trees, shows comparable and widely
overlapping p-distances to the members of the two clades with which it clusters in the different analyses (trnK
intron: 0.00360–0.00639 to clade 48, 0.00320–0.00560 to clade 50; ITS: 0.04011–0.07056 to clade 48, 0.03748–
0.05548 to clade 50).
Relationships of the genera.—The first of our questions, if Dahlgrenodendron, Sinopora, and Yasunia really
belong to the Cryptocarya group, had already been answered positively at an early stage of our investigations by
BLAST searches in GenBank. Therefore, we subsequently concentrated on relationships among the taxa within
this group.
Monotypic Eusideroxylon and Potoxylon have always been considered closely related. Originally, P.
melagangai was even described as a species of Eusideroxylon, but later Kostermans (1978) separated it because of
its different androecial configuration (nine laminar stamens in Potoxylon vs. three columnar stamens in
Eusideroxylon). Based on our results, Potoxylon should be re-united with Eusideroxylon. Their position as sister
to the remainder of the Cryptocarya group had already been found by Chanderbali et al. (2001), albeit with weak
support, in contrast to Rohwer & Rudolph (2005), who found Aspidostemon in this position with moderate support.
In our analyses, the node linking Aspidostemon to all other members of the Cryptocarya group is moderately to
strongly supported. In combination with the results of Chanderbali et al. (2001) that were based on a different set
of molecular markers, it appears a robust assumption.
Our results clearly show that Dahlgrenodendron is closely related to Aspidostemon, not to Cryptocarya, in
which it had been included by Kostermans (1990). Aspidostemon and Dahlgrenodendron share opposite leaves,
flower buds in which the perianth is wider than long, almost sessile anthers, and mostly short inflorescences,
whereas most species of Cryptocarya have alternate leaves, elongate flower buds, anthers with distinct filaments,
and frequently also larger and more profusely branched inflorescences. However, none of these character states is
without exception in the large genus Cryptocarya. Aspidostemon is, however, morphologically sufficiently
homogeneous and distinct from both Cryptocarya and Dahlgrenodendron to assume that it is monophyletic. In
addition, preliminary results based on partial sequences of additional Aspidostemon species (results not shown)
consistently show them as sister to Dahlgrenodendron. Dahlgrenodendron exhibits the presumed plesiomorphic
androecial configuration of Lauraceae, nine fertile stamens plus three staminodes, whereas only three or six outer
stamens are fertile in Aspidostemon with the inner ones transformed into massive, mostly fused staminodes. In
addition, Dahlgrenodendron differs from all other Lauraceae so far investigated in its peculiar striate pollen grains
(van der Merwe et al. 1988).

As in the previous analyses including fewer species (Rohwer 2000; Chanderbali et al. 2001; Rohwer &
Rudolph 2005), Cryptocarya is monophyletic in this analysis, and as had already been recognized earlier (van der
Werff 1992) Ravensara needs to be included in Cryptocarya. New combinations and names that are necessary
have been or will be published elsewhere (van der Werff 2008, 2013). Beilschmiedia, on the other hand, is almost
certainly not monophyletic based on these results, even though the weak support of most basal nodes within the
Beilschmiedia clade (6) leaves some uncertainty. At least Yasunia from South America is clearly nested among
South American Beilschmiedia species. In addition to a few morphological characters (see below), it also shares a
TATGA duplication in the trnK intron downstream from the matK gene with the Beilschmiedia species among
which it is nested (B. emarginata and B. cf. rigida).
Also Potameia consistently has been found nested in Beilschmiedia, although associated with different species
in the trnK and the ITS results. The best support from any analysis (0.98 PP in trnK) suggests that Potameia is
most closely related to Malagasy Beilschmiedia. This appears to be reasonable, as the two Potameia species
included in this study are endemic to Madagascar. The reasons why Potameia and Yasunia are not simply merged
with Beilschmiedia have been explained in the original description of Yasunia (van der Werff & Nishida 2010).
Obviously, the current circumscription of Beilschmiedia, based on morphology, is not satisfactory from a
phylogenetic point of view. It appears premature, however, to make far-reaching taxonomic changes as long as it
remains uncertain if and how the Beilschmiedia complex should be subdivided. Endiandra appears to be
monophyletic if Triadodaphne inaequitepala is included, although support for this clade is really significant only in
BI of trnK. It should be noted, however, that our analysis includes only Endiandra species from Australia and New
Caledonia, but none from central Malesia or mainland Asia. It remains to be determined if these belong to the
same clade. Triadodaphne inaequitepala had originally been described as an Endiandra, but Kostermans (1993)
transferred it to Triadodaphne. Triadodaphne is supposed to differ from Endiandra by larger, thick and fleshy outer
tepals and smaller, membraneous inner tepals as well as a deeply urceolate receptacle vs. more or less equal tepals
and a much shallower receptacle in Endiandra. The specimen that we examined of Triadodaphne inaequitepala,
Pullen 5505 (L), was sterile, but a paratype of the species (Pullen 5508, L), collected by the same collector from
the same locality, had small but thick and fleshy inner tepals and a rather shallow receptacle (drawing available on
lauraceae.myspecies.info). Therefore, we think that at least this species should be treated as Endiandra
inaequitepala Kostermans (1969), as suggested by van der Werff (2001). Unfortunately, we were not able to get
material of the type species of the genus, T. myristicoides Kostermans (1974a: 121), that was suitable for DNA
extraction.
The question whether Endiandra is nested in Beilschmiedia or not cannot yet be answered with certainty.
Based on the trnK analysis it appears to be nested within Beilschmiedia with strong support, whereas based on the
ITS and combined data it may be the sister group to a weakly supported Beilschmiedia in the wider sense, i.e.,
including the other genera of the Beilschmiedia group. This question needs to be further investigated with
additional markers and greater taxonomic sampling, particularly from the Malesian region.
The position of Sinopora hongkongensis also needs further study. This morphologically aberrant genus
appears well supported as sister to a group of Central American Beilschmiedia species in the ITS and combined BI,
but this topology has not been retrieved with other methods of analysis or with trnK alone. In all MP and ML
analyses its position within the Beilschmiedia clade (6) is unresolved, as it is in the BI trnK results. We have
already started a more extensive sampling of Chinese Beilschmiedia species with the cooperation of J. Lie
(Kunming), which may help to elucidate relationships of Sinopora. A future study of this group should also
include the genus Syndiclis, for which we have had no material.
Morphological considerations.—From a morphological point of view, it appears perfectly logical that
Eusideroxylon and Potoxylon are sister to the rest of the Cryptocarya group. As in the outer androecial whorls in
Hypodaphnis, their stamens have four separate pollen sacs in almost collateral arrangement, and their ovary is
semi-inferior, only slightly less so than in Hypodaphnis. All other members of the Cryptocarya group have
stamens with just two distinct pollen sacs—or at least opening by just two valves. In numerous species, there are
four pollen sacs per anther, but the pollen sacs on each side appear to have fused laterally, so that they open by a
single valve on each side of the anther. This is particularly obvious in several species of Endiandra (see Hyland
1989, Figs. 76 F and 78 B), and it has also been observed for Cryptocarya by Moraes (2007). We therefore assume
that bilocular anthers derived by lateral fusion of the pollen sacs are a synapomorphy of the larger part of the
Cryptocarya group. As described by Rohwer (1994), bilocular anthers in other Lauraceae appear to have arisen by
reduction of either the upper or the lower pair of pollen sacs.

The characters typical of Aspidostemon and Dahlgrenodendron (opposite leaves, depressed flower buds,
subsessile anthers) have already been mentioned above. Hypodaphnis, Eusideroxylon, and Potoxylon have
alternate leaves, so that the opposite leaves of Aspidostemon and Dahlgrenodendron may be considered a
synapomorphy of these genera—perhaps a reversal to the ancestral condition, as most other Laurales have opposite
leaves. However, opposite leaves are also found among the remaining genera with considerable frequency, making
it difficult to assess their significance. Flower bud shape and length of filaments are also variable among the other
taxa, particularly within Beilschmiedia.
Cryptocarya is morphologically diverse, but similar enough to be characterized relatively easily, particularly in
its flower structure. Flowers are invariably trimerous, with nine bilocular anthers, three relatively big cordate to
sagittate staminodes, and a deep and narrow receptacular tube enclosing the ovary. In fruit, this receptacular tube
becomes adnate to the ovary and complements the function of the pericarp. This type of fruit is plesiomorphic for
Cryptocarya, as it is also found in Hypodaphnis, Eusideroxylon, Potoxylon, Aspidostemon, and Dahlgrenodendron.
It is, however, not known from the Beilschmiedia clade, which is sister to Cryptocarya. A relatively deep, but
more funnel-shaped than tubular receptacle is found in Triadodaphne myristicoides, but the fruit of this species is
still unknown. The third species of Triadodaphne that has been described so far, T. pachytepala Kostermans (1993:
129), has a shallow receptacle, like most species of Endiandra.
In spite of its strong support in all analyses, the first clade within Cryptocarya separating from the rest of the
genus (clade 8), including C. alba, C. oubatchensis, and C. pluricostata, does not seem to have any obvious
morphological synapomorphies. The leaves of C. alba are opposite and usually broadly elliptic, whereas those of
C. oubatchensis are alternate and usually oblanceolate; those of C. pluricostata are alternate and (ovate-)elliptic.
In the last species they are densely pubescent, whereas in the other two they are glabrous or nearly so. Also in
flowers and fruits, we have not found anything that would separate these three species from the rest of the genus.
Among the remaining clades within Cryptocarya, our sampling is not yet dense enough for a definite statement on
their morphological homogeneity. It is obvious, however, that the triplinerved species (C. densiflora, C.
subtriplinervia, C. triplinervis) do not form a clade.
The Beilschmiedia clade (6) is characterized by flowers with a superior ovary in a relatively shallow receptacle
and by fruits that are (as far as they are known) inserted free on their pedicel, not enclosed in an accrescent
receptacular tube. This appears to be a synapomorphy of this clade based on the topology within the Cryptocarya
group. In floral structures, there is far more variation in the Beilschmiedia clade than in its sister group,
Cryptocarya (van der Werff & Nishida 2010, Tab.1). Dimerous flowers appear to have evolved repeatedly from
normal trimerous flowers, in Potameia and Yasunia quadrata in our sample, but also in Syndiclis and some species
of Endiandra. The number of fertile stamens is often reduced from the normal nine, to six, four, three, or even two.
They may have four well-developed pollen sacs, (mostly) only two recognizable locules, or rarely only a single
locule. The staminal glands can be normally developed, absent, or greatly enlarged to form a glandular cushion.
The staminodia of the fourth androecial whorl can be large and sagittate as in Cryptocarya and most Beilschmiedia
species, massive as in Sinopora and Yasunia, or small, or absent. Considering this wide range of morphological
variation, resolution on the molecular level is surprisingly low. There is enough variation among the species of this
group (176 parsimony-informative positions or up to 77 pairwise differences among the species), but as in the
morphological characters, much of this variation seems to be due to homoplasious change. The low (wellsupported) resolution among the basal nodes, in combination with our limited taxon sample and sometimes
disparate descriptions of the taxa, makes it difficult to recognize morphological patterns. Therefore, we can give
only some tentative suggestions so far. Besides those groups that have been treated as separate genera anyway
(Endiandra, Potameia, Yasunia), the South American clade (29) appears to be recognizable by morphological
characters, as its species (including Yasunia) share opposite leaves with a particularly coarse reticulation. It should
be noted, however, that these characters are also found in the Central American B. brenesii, which is not a member
of this clade in our analysis, but rather sister to B. mexicana, a species with alternate leaves showing the fine
reticulation type described by Nishida & Christophel (1999). The remaining three Neotropical species that we
investigated, B. alloiophylla, B. costaricensis and B. immersinervis, all have alternate leaves with fine reticulation,
and they appear to be sister to the Chinese Sinopora hongkongensis (which also shows these characters, like most
species of the Beilschmiedia clade). Among these, B. alloiophylla and B. costaricensis extend to northwestern
South America as well (see Nishida 1999).

ROHWER ET AL.

Among the Australian species, Beilschmiedia tooram and B. volckii share a reduction to six fertile stamens per
flower. It remains to be checked if other species with a reduced number of stamens (e.g., B. castrisinensis Hyland
[1989: 150] and B. oligandra Smith [1958: 28]; see Hyland 1989) are members of the same clade.
Within Endiandra, our taxon sampling is not yet sufficient to see if there is agreement with morphological
groups described by Hyland (1989). So far, we have only a single member from three of his 10 morphological
groups in our matrix, and we were not yet able to obtain reliable sequences of the species with (up to) six stamens
per flower, E. globosa Maiden & Betche (1899: 149) and E. montana White (1933: 36).
Biogeographical considerations.—Although several of the basal nodes in our cladograms are either
insufficiently resolved or not well supported, some geographical signal is clearly evident in our results. Almost all
well-supported crown groups are geographically homogeneous or nearly so (Fig. 1). The most conspicuous
exception is the relationship of the Chilean Cryptocarya alba to two species from New Caledonia, C. oubatchensis
and C. pluricostata, which was retrieved independently in the trnK and ITS results, invariably with high support.
We assume that this disjunction must have been caused by long distance dispersal across the Pacific. The most
likely vectors for such are fruit-eating birds, even though we do not know of any regular migration routes that
would link these areas. Megachiropterans, which are also fruit eaters and good flyers, are important dispersers in
the Pacific region, but they apparently avoid Lauraceae (Eby 1998), presumably due to the secondary compounds
contained in their fruits. The origin of C. alba is clearly different from that of the other South American
Cryptocarya species, indicating two independent introductions. Several years ago, when New Caledonia was
considered an ancient landmass that had persisted in isolation ever since its separation from Gondwana in the
Cretaceous, this disjunction might have been considered as an example of a relictual range of Gondwana origin.
However, geological studies (cited in Pillon 2012) have recently shown that New Caledonia was completely
submerged until about 37 million years ago, and the levels of genetic divergence are also far too low.
Among the remaining Cryptocarya species (clade 8), the major well-supported clades can be characterized as
Asian–Australian (clade 10), southeastern Brazilian (clade 19), and Malagasy (clade 20). The Hawaiian species
C. mannii and C. oahuensis—which differ from one another by one base pair and a length difference in one of the
poly-T repeats in their trnK sequences, and by three base pairs and a length difference in a poly-G in their ITS
sequences—are clearly members of the Asian–Australian clade. Unfortunately our taxon sampling is not yet
sufficient to pin down their origin more precisely. In any case, their ancestor must have reached its present range
by eastward dispersal. The Malagasy clade is, according to the trnK analyses, apparently sister to the South
American taxa (except C. alba). This relationship, however, appears well supported only in the combined
Bayesian analysis. It remains to be seen if it is upheld when African species, additional Malagasy species, or more
South American species are added to our taxon sample.
In the Beilschmiedia clade (6) support for the basal clades is too low to reach any definite biogeographical
conclusions. During the work on our analyses, we observed that either African or Asian or Australian or Central
American taxa would form the first clade that separated from the rest of the group, depending on the taxon sample,
the included characters and the method of analysis but never with strong support. An Old World origin, however,
has to be assumed because the basal clades of the Cryptocarya group are all paleotropical. In our combined results,
the species from the southwestern Pacific (Australia, New Zealand, New Caledonia, New Guinea; clade 27) are
sister to those from the rest of the world (clade 26), but the support for both clades is low. Within clade 26, we find
a clade consisting of species from (southern) South America (clade 29), Africa and Madagascar (clade 31), and two
in which a mainly Central American group is sister to an Asian group (clades 28 and 30). Also in this case it can be
assumed that a migration between Asia and the Americas occurred more than once, and that the origin of the
species from southern South America is probably different from that of the species from Central America (and
northwestern South America). It would be tempting to think of the former as an ancient Southern Hemisphere
relict and of the latter as a recent immigration after the closure of the Central American land bridge in the Pliocene,
but this idea is not supported by our results, neither by the topology nor low levels of DNA divergence.
Molecular clock?—In phylogenetic studies such as this it has become common practice to estimate the
divergence times of the clades based on calibration of the retrieved topology. However, the reliability of such
estimates depends not only on the quality of the phylogenetic analyses, but even more on the accuracy and
reliability of the calibrations (Graur & Martin 2004). In our analyses, several potentially important nodes are either
poorly resolved or not well enough supported, especially in the Beilschmiedia clade. The calibration problem is
even more serious: how can we confidently assign a fragmentary fossil to a certain clade in a group where it is

often difficult to assign the extant species to their evolutionary lineages based on morphology alone? There are
some fossils that are supposed to belong to the Cryptocarya group, like the Miocene leaf remains described by
Bannister et al. (2012) or those ascribed to Cryptocarya by Holden (1982), but it is unclear at this time how reliable
these determinations are and to which taxa they should refer. Pole (1993) wrote about the material described by
Holden (1982) that “[...] this cannot yet be affirmed, and placement in say, Cinnamomum or Neolitsea ruled out.”
Even if it was Cryptocarya, this would not help in placing of the calibration point. Pole (1993) compared the
fossils to “Cryptocarya macrophylla Guill.” from New Caledonia (probably an error instead of C. macrocarpa
Guillaumin [1924: 1103]; at least the leaf looks like in this species) and to C. triplinervis from Lord Howe Island.
To which clade should be given a mid-Miocene age, clade 7, 9, or 16? Instead of guessing at a possible calibration
point we prefer to postpone a molecular clock analysis until we are more confident about relationships of the extant
species and affinities of fossils to them.

Conclusion
The questions that we raised in the introduction can be answered as follows. (1) Dahlgrenodendron, Sinopora, and
Yasunia are members of the Cryptocarya group. Dahlgrenodendron is sister to Aspidostemon, whereas Sinopora
and Yasunia belong to the Beilschmiedia clade. Yasunia is nested among South American Beilschmiedia species.
The phylogenetic position of Sinopora needs further study. (2) Triadodaphne inaequitepala is a species of
Endiandra. It remains to be determined if this is true for the other two species of Triadodaphne as well. (3)
Cryptocarya is monophyletic, in spite of its morphological diversity. Endiandra appears to be monophyletic as
well, although a broader sampling including species from continental Asia will be necessary to confirm this.
Beilschmiedia is clearly not monophyletic in its present circumscription. At least Potameia and Yasunia are nested
among Beilschmiedia species, possibly also Endiandra and/or Sinopora.
In addition, our study supports the following conclusions: (a) Tetrasporangiate anthers are plesiomorphic in
Lauraceae, and bilocular anthers in the Cryptocarya group (but not in other Lauraceae) have arisen by lateral fusion
of the two pollen sacs of a theca. (b) Within the Cryptocarya group, a superior ovary and consequently a fruit that
is free on its pedicel are synapomorphies of the Beilschmiedia clade. The plesiomorphic conditions appear to be an
ovary that is (semi-)inferior or at least enclosed in the receptacular tube and a fruit in which the fleshy outer layers
are formed by receptacular tissue. (c) The Cryptocarya group originated in the Paleotropics. Its two largest
genera, Beilschmiedia and Cryptocarya, have reached the New World more than once, probably from different
sources.
Still a number of problems remain to be investigated in further studies. The resolution among the basal
lineages within the Beilschmiedia clade needs to be improved by additional molecular markers and collections
from regions that are still relatively poorly represented in our taxon sample (e.g., tropical Africa, subtropical Asia,
the Indian subcontinent, additional Malesian islands). A better circumscription or perhaps subdivision of the genus
Beilschmiedia is needed, integrating molecular and morphological evidence. The positions of Endiandra and
Sinopora relative to the remaining taxa of the Beilschmiedia clade need further study. The genus Syndiclis needs to
be included, with special attention to its relationships with the morphologically similar genus Potameia. Also for
Cryptocarya, additional collections are needed, e.g., from South Africa, Continental Asia and further Pacific
islands. Some of these investigations are under way, but others depend on availability of suitable plant material.
