Abstract
We describe Begonia tandangii, a new species of Begonia sect. Baryandra from the Sierra Madre Mountain Range of
Luzon Island, the Philippines. Begonia tandangii has a close resemblance to B. fenicis in gross morphology, differing in
having leaf margin sparsely fringed with minute hairs (vs. glabrous or with minute hairs only on teeth) and capsules with
broadly-ovate outline and an acuminate apex (vs. capsules with broadly-obovate outline and a rounded to truncate apex).
Phylogenetic analyses of Philippines species of sect. Baryandra based on ITS sequences revealed that B. tandangii was
clearly separated from B. fenicis. Begonia tandangii is currently known only from the type locality in a coastal forest of
Baler, Aurora Province, which is in the neighborhood of Aurora Memorial National Park.
Key words: Begonia, Begoniaceae, ITS phylogeny, Philippines, sect. Baryandra, sect. Diploclinium, Sierra Madre
Mountain Range

Introduction
The genus Begonia Linnaeus (1753: 1056), (Begoniaceae, e.g., Doorenbos et al. 1998) comprises more than
1,500 species (Kiew 2005, Tebbitt 2005). The Philippines, where more than 100 species are recorded
(Golding & Wasshausen 2002), is one of the centers of Begonia species diversity in the world (Rubite 2012).
Philippine begonias are assignable to three sections, namely, sect. Baryandra A. de Candolle (1859: 122),
sect. Petermannia (Klotzsch 1855: 74) A. de Candolle (1859: 128), and sect. Platycentrum (Klotzsch 1855:
123) A. de Candolle (1859: 134) (Rubite 2012, Rubite et al. 2013). Begonia sect. Baryandra includes ca. 50
species, having its center of diversity in the Philippines but also with a few species in Borneo and New Guinea
(Rubite et al. 2013). The section, comprising species previously included in sect. Diploclinium (Lindley ex. R.
Wight 1852: 9) A. de Candolle (1859: 129), has recently been revised (Hughes 2008, Rubite & Madulid 2009,
Hughes et al. 2010, 2011, Rubite 2012, Rubite et al. 2013). However, further field survey in the Philippines
may discover new species because Begonia species generally have narrow distribution ranges and the
Philippines has not been botanically fully explored (Rubite & Madulid 2009).
The Sierra Madre is a chain of mountains in the eastern coast of north and central Luzon Island (14°–19°
N; Fig. 1), where the largest contiguous forest in the Philippines is found. In the south-central part of the
mountain range, we discovered an unknown Begonia which resembles B. fenicis Merrill (1908: 421) of sect.
Baryandra in gross morphology, green (neither purple-brown nor purplish-red) and non-peltate leaves, and
five-tepalled pistillate flowers. Begonia fenicis has been reported from islets north of Luzon Island but not
from Luzon Island (Merrill 1908, Hatusima 1975, Chen 1993). Basing on detailed morphological and
molecular phylogenetic analyses, we confirmed that the unknown Begonia is a new species of sect.
Baryandra, which is named Begonia tandangii C.-I Peng & R.Rubite (below).

Materials and Methods
Morphological study
Four plants of Begonia tandangii (Ching-I Peng 23400, HAST) were studied. For comparison, specimens
of B. fenicis in PNH and HAST were examined (Appendix 1); these specimens covered the entire range of B.
fenicis and included an isolectotype (E. Fénix, Bur. Sci. 3619, PNH) and isosyntypes (E.A. Mearns, Bur. Sci.
3207, PNH; E. Fénix, Bur. Sci. 3893, PNH) (Merrill 1912 [1911]).
Molecular analyses
Total genomic DNA was extracted from four plants of B. tandangii (Ching-I Peng 23400, HAST) using
fresh leaves following the method of Murray & Thompson (1980). ITS region (including ITS1 and ITS2 spacer
regions and the 5.8S rRNA gene) was amplified using PCR. PCR was performed in 25 µl total volume with the
following reagents: about 10 ng of genomic DNA, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase master mix (Ampliqon,
Rødovre, Denmark), 0.4 μM of each primer, and 2% DMSO. The primers ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990)
were used, with the PCR cycle condition 95°C for 5 min, 1 cycle of 97°C for 2 min, 50°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1
min, 25 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, 72°C for 3 min, and 72°C for 10 min. The PCR fragments
were used as templates for cycle sequencing reactions with the same primers used in the PCR, and direct
sequencing was performed on an ABI Prism 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
The four samples had identical ITS sequence, and thus one accession was used for B. tandangii in the following
analyses. The sequence was deposited in the DDBJ (DNA Data Bank of Japan) databases (since 1983).

To test the phylogenetic distinction of B. tandangii, we incorporated 21 out of 55 species of sect.
Baryandra (including B. fenicis) in phylogenetic analyses: 19 from the Philippines and 2 from Borneo
(Appendix 2). ITS data for these species were reported in a preceding molecular study of sect. Baryandra
(Rubite et al. 2013). For outgroups, three species of sect. Reichenheimea (Klotzsch 1855: 54) A. de Candolle
(1864: 385) were used (Appendix 2), following the result of Rubite et al. (2013). DNA sequences were
aligned using ClustalX ver. 1.8 (Thompson et al. 1997) and then manually adjusted. Phylogenetic analyses
were based on a Bayesian approach using MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) and a
maximum parsimony (MP) criterion using PAUP* ver. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002).
In the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis, the substitution model for the ITS data was selected using
KAKUSAN4 (Tanabe 2011) based on Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Two separate runs of Metropolis
coupled Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) analyses were performed, each with a random starting tree
and four chains (one cold and three heated). The MCMCMC length was three million generations, and the
chain was sampled every one hundredth generation from the cold chain. The mixing and convergence of the
MCMC chains of the two runs was assessed by inspection of the trace plots of parameters using Tracer ver.
1.5.0 (Drummond & Rambaut 2007); the first 3000 sample trees (10% of the total 30,000 sample trees) were
discarded as burn-in. After the burn-in, the effective sample sizes (ESS) of all parameters were > 200,
indicating that the analyses sampled the posterior distributions of each parameter satisfactorily, and the values
of Average Standard Deviation of Split Frequency (ASDSF) were below 0.005. The 50% majority rule
consensus tree and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) of all the post-burn-in trees was generated using
TreeView ver. 1.6.6 (Page 1996).
In the MP phylogenetic analysis, indels were treated as missing data. The characters were treated as
unordered, and the character transformations were equally weighted. The branch collapse option was set to
collapse at a minimum length of zero. A heuristic parsimony search was performed with 200 replicates of
random additions of sequences with ACCTRAN character optimization, tree bisection–reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping, and MULTREES and STEEPEST DESCENT options on. Statistical support for each clade
was assessed by bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein 1985). Ten thousand replicates of heuristic searches, with the
TBR branch swapping switched on and MULTREES options off, were performed to calculate bootstrap
percentages (BP).
Chromosome Cytology
Somatic chromosome morphology was studied for two plants of B. tandangii (Ching-I Peng 23400,
HAST) and three plants of B. fenicis (the Philippines, Lutao Island, Niutoushan, Koh Nakamura 20101493;
Taiwan, Lanyu Island, Zhonghenggonglu, Koh Nakamura 20101366; Japan, Iriomote Island, Hinai River,
Koh Nakamura 20100209, HAST). The procedures of pretreatment, fixation and staining for chromosome
observations followed Peng et al. (2012).

Results
Morphological study
Detailed morphological comparison between Begonia tandangii and B. fenicis found salient characters to
distinguish them. In Begonia tandangii, leaf margin was sparsely fringed with minute hairs less than 1 mm
long; capsules were broadly ovate in outline, with an acuminate apex (Fig. 2 & 3). On the other hand, in B.
fenicis, leaf margin was glabrous or had minute hairs only on teeth; capsules were broadly obovate in outline,
with a rounded to truncate apex (Fig. 4). In other features, these two species were not clearly distinguished
because character states/values in B. tandangii were within variation ranges of those in B. fenicis.

Phylogenetic relationships based on ITS
The aligned length of the ITS data was 842 bp. 275 nucleotide substitutions were found in 192 variable
sites and 130 sites were parsimony informative among them. In the Bayesian analysis, the BIC selected the
GTR+G substitution model. The 50% majority rule consensus tree with mean branch length of all the postburn-in trees is depicted (Fig 5). The MP analysis yielded 7 equally parsimonious trees of 761 steps with a
consistency index (CI) = 0.656, a retention index (RI) = 0.712, and a rescaled consistency index (RC) = 0.467.
The topology of the MP strict consensus tree (not shown) was the same as that of the Bayesian tree, except the
three nodes which collapsed in the MP tree (BP < 50). BPs are plotted on the Bayesian tree. Begonia
tandangii resided in a well-supported clade (PP = 0.97 / BP = 97.9) with B. chloroneura P.Wilkie & Sands
(1999: 132), B. fenicis, B. hernandioides Merrill (1912 [1911]: 392) and B. tayabensis Merrill (1918: 38). In
this clade, B. tandangii and B. fenicis were clearly separated because B. fenicis formed a terminal clade with
B. hernandioides (PP = 0.97 / BP = 71.9), which clade was connected with B. chloroneura (PP = 0.99 / BP =
78.3).

Chromosome Cytology
Somatic chromosomes at metaphase of Begonia tandangii were determined to be 2n = 28 in the two plants
(Fig. 6A), and those of B. fenicis were also determined to be 2n = 28 in the three plants (Fig. 6B). The 28
chromosomes gradually varied in length from ca. 0.9 to 1.3 μm in B. tandangii, and from ca. 1.1 to 1.7 μm in
B. fenicis. The centromere positions could not be determined due to the small size of the chromosomes. This
result differs from a previous report of the chromosome number of B. fenicis (2n = 26; Oginuma & Peng
2002). Our study revealed that B. tandangii and B. fenicis had the same chromosome number and were
karyologically indistinguishable.

Discussion
The results of the morphological and molecular analyses support the taxonomic treatment of Begonia
tandangii as a new species of sect. Baryandra. The phylogenetic analyses indicated that this new species is
allied to the species found in Luzon Island (B. chloroneura in Isabela, B. hernandioides in Ilocos Norte, and

B. tayabensis in Laguna; Rubite 2010) and the northern islands (B. fenicis in Batan and Babuyan island groups
of the Philippines, Lanyu and Lutao islands of Taiwan, and Yonaguni and Iriomote islands of Japan; Merrill
1908, Hatusima 1975, Chen 1993). Begonia tandangii and these four species share a noticeable
morphological characteristic of five-tepalled pistillate flowers, while other species of sect. Baryandra have
four-tepalled pistillate flowers (Hughes et al. 2010, Rubite et al. 2013).

Taxonomic Treatment
Begonia tandangii C.-I Peng & R.Rubite, sp. nov. (Fig. 2 & 3)
Begonia tandangii resembles B. fenicis in gross morphology, differing from the latter in having leaf margin sparsely
fringed with minute hairs (vs. glabrous or with minute hairs only on teeth) and capsules with broadly-ovate outline,
acuminate apex, and rounded base (vs. capsules with broadly-obovate outline, rounded to truncate apex, and
rounded base).
Type:––PHILIPPINES. Luzon Island, Aurora Province, Baler, Barangay Zabali, elev. ca. 10 m, E121° 33' 1", N15° 45'
16", 27 October 2011, Ching-I Peng 23400 (holotype HAST).

Monoecious perennial herbs, rhizomatous. Stems pink when young, green when mature, prostrate, to 1 cm in
diameter, internodes 5–13 mm. Stipules pink to green, caducous, ovate to triangular, 1.2–2.5 × 0.8–1.2 cm,
adaxially glabrous, abaxially sparsely puberulous with minute hairs, with a prominent keel, apex cuspidate.
Leaves basal, alternate; petiole pink, 8.5–20 cm × 5 mm, erect, terete, succulent, glabrous to remotely
puberulous; blade green, obliquely ovate to orbicular, 8.4–12.5 × 6.8–10.5 cm, adaxially glabrous, abaxially
glabrous or sparsely puberulous with fine hairs, venation palmate, 8–10-veined, base oblique, cordate, basal
lobes rounded, sinus narrow, apex mucronate to acuminate, margin with sparse minute hairs less than 1 mm
long and irregularly denticulate, teeth small, apiculate. Inflorescences axillary, arising directly from rhizome,
dichasial cymes; peduncle green, basally pink, 18–24 cm long, glabrous; bracts caducous, orbicular to oblate,
4–6 × 6–10 mm, glabrous, margin entire and often reflexed, apex obtuse to apiculate. Staminate flowers:
pedicel ca. 1.5 cm, glabrous or sparsely puberulous with fine hairs; tepals 4, pinkish white, outer 2 obovate to
orbicular, 10–13 × 8–12 mm, inner 2 oblanceolate to narrowly obovate, 7–10 × 3–5 mm; stamens ca. 30;
filaments ca. 1.5 mm long, united at base; anthers broadly obovate, ca. 1.0 mm long, apex obtuse. Pistillate
flowers: pedicel 1.5–2 cm, glabrous or sparsely puberulous with fine hairs; tepals 5, pinkish white, sometimes
persistent when fruiting, oblanceolate to broadly obovate, outer pair orbicular 10–11 × 8 mm, inner three 10–
11 × 5–8 mm; ovary green, glabrous, 3-loculed; placentae axile, bilamellate; styles 3, fused at base, ca. 3 mm
long; stigmas 2-cleft, spiraled. Capsules nodding, brown, glabrous, 4–5 × 10–11 mm (excluding wings),
broadly ovate in outline, apex acuminate, base rounded; unequally 3-winged; abaxial wing lunate, 3–5 × 10–
11 mm; lateral wings lunate, 1–2 × 10–11 mm. Somatic chromosome number, 2n = 28 (Fig. 6).
Distribution, habitat and ecology:—Begonia tandangii is currently known only from the type locality.
The species grows on limestone rocks in semi-shaded hill of broadleaf forest at seashore and only a patch of a
few square meters was observed. The species was flowering and fruiting when collected in late October. In
cultivation in the greenhouse of Academia Sinica in Taipei, Taiwan, it flowered and fruited from July to
December.
Etymology:—The species epithet is named after Mr. Danilo N. Tandang, Philippine National Herbarium,
who guided us to the type locality.
Note:—Begonia tandangii resembles B. fenicis in gross morphology but they are distinguished basing on
hairs on leaf margin and capsule shape, as described above. The ITS phylogeny clearly separated the two
species. The two species are allopatric.
IUCN Red list category:—Vulnerable (VU D2). Begonia tandangii is known only from the type locality
in Baler, Aurora Province. Although it is in the neighborhood of Aurora Memorial National Park, the type
locality is not under any protection. Habitat disturbance brought about by timber harvesting and rapid
development of Aurora Province may have a negative impact on the survival of the species.
