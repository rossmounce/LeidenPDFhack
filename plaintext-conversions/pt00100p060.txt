This paper forms a part of the studies towards a World Monograph of Nepenthes Linnaeus (1753: 955)
building on a Skeletal Revision of Nepenthes (Jebb & Cheek 1997) and the Flora Malesiana account (Cheek
& Jebb 2001). In the course of studying previously unseen specimens from the Philippines, four sheets
(Ramos & Edanõ 45690, K, NY, UC, US), of a species previously unknown came to light from Mt Alzapan.
The oblong, glabrous, ligulate, sessile leaf-blades with 5–7 pairs of nearly evenly spaced longitudinal nerves
placed the species unambiguously in the Insignes group of Danser (1928) which is restricted to the Philippines
apart from one species, N. insignis Danser (1928: 314), in New Guinea and, more ambiguously, N. northiana
Hooker, J.D. (1881: 717) in Borneo (Cheek & Jebb 2001).
The Insignes group are also characterised by more or less broadly cylindrical upper pitchers with a length:
breadth ratio of 3 or 4:1 (constricted at the waist in N. ventricosa Blanco (1837: 807) which bear a broad
peristome, semi-circular in section, the inner edge of which is prominently toothed, the outer attenuating in
thickness until it is membranous. The lower surface of the pitcher lid lacks an appendage. The nectar glands
are usually transversely elliptic, non-perithecoidal and are absent from the midline, being restricted to two
incurved lateral bands.
In the key to Philippine species of Nepenthes, Cheek & Jebb (2001) the species described below as N.
alzapan, keys out as the small-pitchered N. bellii K.Kondo (1969: 653) of Mindanao. The two taxa appear
similar in terms of overall dimensions of the pitchers. However, the upper pitchers of N. bellii, while broadly
similar to those of N. alzapan, differ significantly in their finer peristome, and sparse lid glands (Table 1). In
practice N. alzapan being restricted to Luzon, is unlikely to be confused with N. bellii, which is restricted to
Mindanao. It is more likely that its leaves, stems and inflorescences might be identified as N. ventricosa, the
only other species of this group in Luzon. However the upper pitchers of N. ventricosa are much larger and
longer than in N. alzapan, 9–16 × 3–8cm and hour-glass shaped, lacking fringed wings, and the lid is narrowly
elliptic 4–6 × 1.8–2.25 cm.

Nepenthes alzapan Jebb & Cheek, sp. nov. Type:—PHILIPPINES. Luzon, “Tayabas Prov., Mt Alzapan”, male
fl. 7 June 1925, Ramos & Edanõ 45690 (holotype K!; isotypes NY!, UC!, US!) (Fig. 1).
Diagnosis:—A Nepenthes bellio caulibus acute trigonis atque conspicue alatis (nec teretibus nec leviter
angularibus, nec alatis), ascidiis superioribus globosis, 6.5-6.8 x 4.2-5cm, (nec infundibuliformis, 7.3–7.5 ×
2–2.5cm); inflorescentia masculi 31.5–42 × 1.5–2cm (nec 10–15 x 1 cm) differt.
Description:—Terrestrial climber (probably) to at least 0.4 m tall. Stems alabaster to pale browncoloured, acutely triangular in transverse section, 5(–7) mm diam., two of three angles extended into wings up
to 3–4 mm wide, decurrent from the leaves, internodes 1.3–2 cm long, glabrous but with scattered sessile red
-coloured glands. Leaves coriaceous, sessile, ligulate–oblong, (7–)8–13.5 × 1.5–2.5(–3.4) cm, apex acute,
base clasping the stem for 2/3 its circumference, decurrent almost to the node below as a wing up to 4mm
wide. Longitudinal nerves 5–7 on each side of the midrib, almost evenly scattered. Pennate nerves irregular,
oblique. Indumentum as stem. Lower pitchers not recorded. Upper pitchers subglobose to globoseinfundibuliform, 6.5–6.8 × 4.2–5 cm, with moderately sparse appressed simple hairs 0.2–0.5 mm long; wings
present only for 5–17 mm of the pitcher length, at the midpoint or apex, 1–2 mm wide, with fringed elements
1.5 mm apart, 3–4mm long with moderately sparse simple or basally 2–3-branched hairs 0.1–0.15 mm long;
mouth suborbicular, forming the broadest part of the pitcher; peristome subcylindrical to flattened, 6–10(–
14)mm broad, ribs 1.5 mm apart, about 0.25 mm high, outer margin entire, revolute, inner margin dentate,
teeth curved, 0.5–0.75 mm; lid elliptic, 2.5–2.7 × 2.2–2.3 cm, apex rounded, base truncate; lower surface
lacking appendages, midline thickened and lacking nectar glands which occur only in two curved lateral
bands, each with 35–110 glands, densest at base of the lid, where 3 per mm²; nectar glands slightly
transversely elliptic or suborbicular 0.3–0.5 × 0.3–0.5mm, with a thin marginal rim 0.05 mm thick; sessile
red-coloured glands 0.05–0.07 mm in diameter, about 4 per mm², spur not recorded. Male inflorescence 31.5–
42 × 1.5–2.5 cm, indumentum dense, completely covering the surface, hairs simple, bronze-coloured, 0.15–
0.35 mm long; peduncle 20–22.5 cm long, 3–4.5 mm diam.; rhachis 11.5–20 cm long, with partial-peduncles
80–110, 1-flowered; bracts inconspicuous, at apex of inflorescence only, about 0.2 mm long, inserted 0.3–1.5
mm from junction with rhachis; pedicels 7–8(–10) mm long; tepals red, narrowly elliptic, 3.5 × 1.5–1.8 mm,
lower surface and margins completely covered in sinuous thin-walled bronze-coloured hairs about 0.1 mm
long, apices round; staminal column 2–2.5 mm long, with thinly scattered ± patent copper-coloured hairs
0.25–0.35 mm long; anther-head globose, about 1.5 mm diam. Female inflorescences, infructescences and
seed unknown.
Etymology:—The epithet alzapan refers to Mt. Alzapan, the type locality.
Distribution & ecology:—Philippines, Luzon, Sierra Madre Mts., Mt Alzapan, submontane mossy
forest, 1800 m a.s.l.
Conservation:—Nepenthes alzapan is known only from three individuals at most, at a single location on
an island which has seen high-levels of habitat-loss in the twentieth century (Sohmer & Davis 2007). The
species appears not to have been seen alive since 1925, and may already be extinct as is thought to be the case
with N. robcantleyi Cheek (2011: 678). Nepenthes alzapan is here assessed as Critically Endangered under
IUCN (2001), Criterion D. It is to be hoped that the species will be rediscovered at the type location and
perhaps additional locations and that it will not prove to be so rare or as threatened as existing data suggest.
However Sohmer & Davis (2007) document two other species, Psychotria alzapaniensis Sohmer & A. Davis
(2007: 123) and Psychotria longissima Quisumbing & Merrill (1928: 206) which are also known only from
Ramos & Edanõ type specimens made in 1925 at the same location. Both species they assess as Critically
Endangered, if not extinct (Sohmer & Davis 2007).
