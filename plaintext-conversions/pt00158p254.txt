Abstract
Eryngium viviparum is an endemic plant of the Atlantic regions of Europe. Surveys carried out in recent years in the
wetlands of northwest Spain have led to the identification of several previously undetected subpopulations of this species
in inland areas with markedly Mediterranean bioclimatic characteristics that constitute the southern limit of this species.
However, these populations overlap with the distribution of the Iberian endemic E. galioides, similar in size and
morphology. We developed a biometric study on herbarium vouchers that has enabled us to identify a new subspecies,
subspecies bariegoi, distributed in a limited geographical zone in Mediterranean areas of the northwest Iberian
Peninsula.

Introduction
Eryngium viviparum J.Gay (1848: 171) is a small plant growing in seasonally flooded sites (Cook 1983, 1990; Arts
& Den Hartog 1990; Rodríguez-Oubiña et al. 1997). Since 1979 this species has been included in Annex I (strictly
protected plant species) of the Berne Convention (1979), and is also listed as a priority species in Annex II of The
Habitats Directive (1992). Today there is a single known subpopulation in France (in Morbihan, Brittany) (Annezo
et al. 1995; Buord et al. 1999). The remaining subpopulations are all in northwest Spain, in the Region of Galicia,
where it is considered threatened and has recently been rated as “Endangered” (Romero & Rubinos 2003; Romero
et al. 2004).
Surveys carried out in recent years in the wetlands in the northwest Iberian Peninsula have led to the detection
of several previously undetected subpopulations of this species in inland areas with markedly Mediterranean
bioclimatic characteristics. These subpopulations, located in the Region of Castile-León, constitute the southern
limit of this species’ known range (see Fig. 1). Nevertheless, recent molecular data on this population has shown
that the genetic distance between the Atlantic subpopulations (Galicia and Brittany) is lower than the distance
between the Spanish subpopulations (Galicia and Castile-León) (Rodríguez-Gacio et al. 2009). Moreover, the
monitoring of the northwest Iberian subpopulations has revealed morphological differences between them. In this
paper we show that these differences are measurable. This information will be important for the preservation of the
genetic and morphological variability of this rare species, which is associated to a very selective habitat (Menges
1986; Soltis & Gitzendanner 1998).

Material & methods
Morphometric data
This study was based on specimens from all three subpopulations deposited in the following herbaria: the Paris
Herbarium (Herbier National de Paris-Muséum National d'Histoire Naturelle), the location of the original type

material, where we revised 16 vouchers with an average of 18 specimens per voucher; and the SANT Herbarium
(University of Santiago de Compostela), where the Spanish subpopulation is very well represented, with 32
vouchers each with an average of six specimens.
Eryngium viviparum is a biennial plant that in its first year produces only a basal leaf rosette. In the second
year, when the water disappears in early summer, the plant develops inflorescences with some basal leaves rosettes
at the end of stoloniferous branches. Each individual can produce several inflorescences throughout its life and they
form a series that can be followed from the initial inflorescence, identified here as R0, to the last inflorescence
produced. The highest inflorescence order identified was R7.
From an initial inspection of the vouchers and our field experience, we determined the shapes of the leaves and
bracteoles to be the morphological characters that showed the greatest differences between subpopulations. To
quantify these differences, more than two thousand photographs of the specimens in the herbaria vouchers were
taken with the aid of a digital camera connected to a stereomicroscope. Then, we measured the length and width of
the leaves and the bracteoles with a specific software developed by one of the authors. The width measurements
were taken at the widest part of the leaf or bracteole. With these data we also calculated length/width ratios for
bracteoles and leaves.

Statistical analysis
The data were analysed as an ANOVA with two crossed factors: subpopulations (three levels: 1) France, 2) Galicia,
and 3) Castile-León); and inflorescence order (eight levels from R0 to R7, although not all were included in the
analysis; see below).

The design, however, was not balanced since low-order inflorescences were less abundant due to the
desiccation and death of the oldest parts of the plant, and because many plants did not produce inflorescences of a
very high order. Table 1 shows the number of samples (n) in each group. Owing to the considerable differences in
the quantity of samples among the groups, we did not include groups with a small number of samples in the
statistical analysis, i. e. R6 and R7 (bracteoles) and R0, R6 and R7 (leaf). However, Fig. 2 includes all the data.

FIGURE 2. Means and distributions of the bracteole length data. The box-plots summarize the distribution of the data grouped by
subpopulation and rosette order. The overlayed symbols represent the means for those groups (France: solid line and dots, Galicia:
dashed line and squares, Castile-León: dash-dot line and triangles). The upper graph shows the original data and the lower graph the
data after logarithmic transformation. The distributions of the transformed data showed improvements in symmetry and
homoscedasticity. The parallel, descendent, non-overlapping mean lines for the three populations indicate the existence of significant
effects due to both factors (subpopulation and rosette order) and the lack of significant interaction between them.

As a first step in the analysis, we carried out normality and homoscedasticity tests in order to determine
whether the data met the conditions needed for a formal ANOVA test. To do this we applied the Shapiro Wilks test
of normality and the Fligner-Killeen test of homoscedasticity to the groups with sufficient data. This is one of the
most efficient tests in the presence of non-normal data distributions (Conover et al. 1981). As will be explained in
the results section, we applied a logarithmic transformation to improve both the normality and homoscedasticity of
the data.
To show the differences among subpopulations in the variables analysed we employed the means of ten
individuals instead of the original data themselves, thereby reducing the variability of the data and making the
differences between the subpopulations clearer. To do this we resampled the data with replacement to form groups
of ten randomly selected individuals, and calculated their means. We repeated this procedure 10,000 times (Jackson
and Somers 1989). The resampling was done within each subpopulation independently (i.e. 30,000 means were
calculated). Finally, we applied kernel smoothing in its uni- and bivariate variants to estimate the density
distribution functions of the means (Wand and Jones 1995).
All the calculations and graphs were done with the R language (R Development Core Team 2011), and
Package KernSmooth (Wand 2011) used for kernel smoothing procedures.

Results
We found that a logarithmic transformation of the data greatly improved their homoscedasticity. This can be seen in
Fig. 2, which shows the original and transformed data for bracteole length. It also produced a general improvement
in the normality of the data. However, a small number of groups with normal distributions prior to the
transformation become not normally distributed afterwards. It should be noted, however, that we set a probability
limit of p<0.05, which made our tests conservative. A lower limit –say 0.01– would have identified fewer groups as
non-normal. Despite this, we decided to apply the transformation to all the data, since the sensitivity of the
ANOVA to heteroscedasticity is greater than its sensitivity to departures from normality. Fig. 2 shows the original
data for bracteole length and the same data after transformation and clearly demonstrates the advantages of the
transformation, particularly with regard to the stabilisation of the variances. The Mediterranean samples had
greater variances than the Atlantic samples prior to the transformation.
The results of the ANOVAs are presented in Appendix I. Most of them detected significant effects (p<0.001)
for both factors but none detected interaction effects. The cases for which a factor effect was found less significant
(0.050 > p >0.001) were the subpopulation factor for leaf width and the rosette factor for leaf length/leaf width.
Although the results of the ANOVA showed differences between subpopulations, the dispersion of the
individual measurements was large, thus producing a substantial overlap among the data distributions. This makes
it quite difficult to assign an individual to any of the three subpopulations based on a single measurement.
Fortunately, this problem can be solved by using the mean of several measurements as the basis for comparison.
We used the resampling procedure described in the methods section to construct the distribution of the means of
groups of ten measurements. We also tested this method using the means of smaller groups, but we found that the
resolution power was not sufficient to achieve a clear separation between subpopulations.
We found that the most resolutive variables were those related to bracteole shape. Fig. 3 shows a contour graph
representing the bivariate density function estimated with kernel smoothing for the variables bracteole length and
bracteole width (means of ten measurements). It shows that the Mediterranean subpopulation can be clearly
differentiated from the two Atlantic subpopulations, although these two subpopulations – while different – show a
large degree of overlap which makes them more difficult to differentiate.

FIGURE 3. Bivariate probability density plot for the variables bracteole length and bracteole width. The isolines are 0.2 probability
units apart, and those with a thicker line are the 1.0 and 2.0 levels. Note that although the three modes are clearly distinguishable, there
is a large overlap between the Galician and French subpopulations.

The graph also suggests that a more synthetic method of differentiating the individuals belonging to the
Mediterranean subpopulation would be the ratio between bracteole length/bracteole width (Bl/Bw). We calculated
this quotient for the resampled data (means of ten measurements as before), and Fig. 4 shows the density function
for these data. The value Bl /B w = 7 can be considered the limit between the values obtained for the Atlantic
subpopulations (which are lower than this value) and the Mediterranean subpopulation. It should be noted that all

these calculations were done with untransformed data. An important point to note is that the resampling procedure
did not distinguish between rosette orders. As a consequence, any group of ten measurements could serve to
identify the subpopulation of origin without any need to take into account the order of the rosettes from which the
data were collected.

FIGURE 4. Probability density functions of the means (n = 10) of the ratio between bracteole length and width for the three
subpopulations. Solid line: Brittany, dashed line: Galicia, dash-dot line: Castile-León. Each distribution was estimated by resampling
the data for the corresponding subpopulation.

Discussion
The results showed that there were significant differences between subpopulations and between inflorescence
orders, and also that there were no significant interactions between factors. The interpretation of these results can
clearly be observed in Fig. 2. The mean bracteole length values in the Mediterranean subpopulation were
consistently higher than those in the other two subpopulations for all rosette orders. Likewise, a reduction in the
mean size was observed with the inflorescence order, and this occurred simultaneously and in parallel in the three
subpopulations, which justifies the lack of interaction between the two factors. The patterns shown in Fig. 2 are
shared by the other variables, and we thus omitted these graphs. Although all the ANOVAs showed that there were
significant differences between subpopulations, these were harder to appreciate in the case of the leaf variables, due
to their greater variability. This fact justified the use of bracteole characteristics to differentiate the subpopulations.
Moreover, leaves tend to disappear throughout the growing season, whereas the bracteoles persist.
The significance of the inflorescence order factor for all the variables is the result of a decrease in both the
width and length of the leaves and bracteoles as the inflorescence order increases. The length/width ratio also
diminishes with order. These relationships are consistently higher for the Mediterranean subpopulation, which have
narrower leaves and bracteoles compared to the other two subpopulations. In addition to these features, the
appearance of the Mediterranean plants was spiny and coriaceous, similar to a small thistle, while the plants from
the Atlantic subpopulations had a soft and fleshy appearance.
This species is morphologically very similar to E. galioides Lam. (1798:757), an aquatic plant endemic to the
western Iberian Peninsula and with which it has been confused (Nieto Feliner 2003). Both species seem to be close
relatives (Chater 1968; Nieto Feliner op cit.), but unfortunately, there are not data to support a discussion of their
taxonomic relationship. We have included E. galiodes in the key at the end of the paper in order to facilitate its
differentiation from the subspecies of E. viviparum.
The morphological data presented here, in conjunction with the aforementioned genetic data (Rodríguez-Gacio
et al. 2009), lead us to conclude that the Mediterranean subpopulation can be considered as a distinct subspecies
from the Atlantic ones (see the keys of Chater (1968) and Nieto Feliner (2003)).

Eryngium viviparum J. Gay subsp. bariegoi M. I. Romero Buján & C. Real subsp. nov. (Fig. 5)
Eryngium viviparum J.Gay subsp. bariegoi is similar to E. viviparum subsp. viviparum, from which it is easily distinguished by
the bracteoles of the flowers which are very narrow and long, presenting appear nearly awned. As a result the new
subspecies is a spiny plant, like a tiny thistle.
Type:—SPAIN. Zamora: Otero de Bodas 29TQG3347, 828 m, 1 January 2003, MI. Romero, P. Ramil & P. Bariego 2424
(holotype SANT! [SANT 50009 specimen on the top left], isotypes: remaining specimens).
Herbaceous spiny plant with procumbent stems 1(−2) mm; basal leaves linear-lanceolate, dentate, with lamina decurrent on
petiole and present at the time of flowering. Inflorescence cylindrical, capitula with similar bracts and bracteoles, rigid and
lanceolate-acuminate with 1 spine. Bracteoles > 7 times longer than wide.

Distribution and habitat:—Endemic subspecies from the Mediterranean areas of the Northwest of the Iberian
Peninsula. The plant grows in very shallow temporary ponds which exist only in winter. The habitat is indicated as
a priority habitat type (3170 * Mediterranean temporary ponds) in the Annex I of The Habitats Directive (1992)
into the freshwater habitats, standing water.
Etymology:—In recognition of his dedication and contribution to the study of the local flora, the subspecies is
dedicated to Patricio Bariego, Technical Staff of Natural Parks Service of Castile-León Community.

Comparison with the type subspecies:—The new subspecies can be differentiated from E. viviparum subsp.
viviparum by the bracteoles of the flowers (Fig. 5), which are narrower and longer than in the subspecies
viviparum. This can be done by measuring the length and width of ten bracteoles and then calculating the quotient
of these variables. Samples with a mean value greater than seven belong to E. viviparum subsp. bariegoi. When
making the selection of bracteoles the rosette order is not relevant, and data from different individuals can be
pooled if needed.

Conservation status:—According to IUCN (2012) the species can be assigned as endangered (EN, criterion
and subcriteria B2ac), due to its highly restricted area of occupancy (less than 500 km²) and to the severe
fragmentation of its population, which is linked to a very selective habitat “seasonal pools or temporary
Mediterranean pools”.These habitats are affected by different types of disturbances: changes in land use (drainage,
water pollution, etc.), or human or animal pressure, which result in habitat loss. In addition, the number of mature
individuals is subject to extreme annual fluctuations because summer heat waves do not allow the development of
fruits. As a consequence, climatic change is also a potential risk for this species.
