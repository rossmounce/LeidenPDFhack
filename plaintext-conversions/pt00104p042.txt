Abstract
Cyclotella iranica sp. nov. is described from the Karaj River, Iran. The morphology of Cyclotella iranica is documented
with light and scanning electron micrographs and discussed in comparison with several related species: Cyclotella fottii,
C. delicatula, C. andancensis var. adnanensis, C. andancensis var. bauzilensis and C. andancensis var. bipolaira.
Cyclotella iranica shares with these related Cyclotella species the following features: unequal stria pattern, one sessile
rimoportula and several marginal fultoportulae. It is distinguished from them by the position of central fultoportula(e),
which is (are) situated at the central end of the striae. It is known only from the type locality; the autecology of Cyclotella
iranica shows that it is tolerant of nutrient and organic enrichment.
Key words: Cyclotella, centric diatom, new species, Iran, Karaj River

Introduction
The Karaj River is one of the longest rivers of the Central Iranian Plateau (245 km; Bakhtiari 2008). Its water
is used for agriculture, gardening and drinking by the residents of the Karaj River valley (and subcatchments); it also meets the industrial and agricultural demands of the cities of Karaj, Tehran, Shahriar and
Varamin (Rahmati 2007). This area of Iran is little studied for its diatom flora (Jamalou et al. 2007); the
diatom flora of the Karaj River has not been investigated. The river suffers from heavy pollution due to
unregulated releases of rural waste, primarily from the restaurants along the river and surrounding villages.
Because of the Karaj River's primary importance to the province of Tehran, this study was undertaken to
explore the diatom diversity of the river and to evaluate the relationship of the diatom communities to water
quality.
The river starts in the north-western region of the plateau on the southern slope of the Albourz range. Its
main tributaries are Welayat Rud, located in the north of Tehran, and Warange Rud beginning in the central
Albourz ranges and located in the north-west of Karaj. These streams join at Gachsar to form the Karaj River.
The catchment area of the Karaj River is 840 km2. This terrain is delimited to the north by the central Albourz
mountain ranges, the south by the city of Karaj, the east by the mountainous terrain of Tehran, and the west by
the north end of Karaj (Rahmati 2007).
Epipelic samples were taken from the margins of the river monthly from March 2011 to April 2012.
During this research, a new species of Cyclotella was discovered near the Aderan Village, downstream of the
Amir Kabir Dam about 12 km along the road from Karaj to Chalous (35°53´N, 51°4´ E, elevation 1555 m).

The new species, named here as Cyclotella iranica sp. nov, is described using light (LM) and scanning
electron microscopy (SEM). Its relationship to allied Cyclotella species is discussed.

Material and methods
Epipelic and epilithic samples were collected from six sites (Fig. 1) along the Karaj River:
Site 1. Downstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 35°50´N, 51°4´ E, elevation 1405 m, near the village of
Kondor at Sarvdar Path.
Site 2. Downstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 35°53´N, 51°4´ E, elevation 1555 m, near the village of
Aderan.
Sites 3. Upstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 36°01´N, 51°8´ E, elevation 1802 m, near the village of Khab
bridge.
Site 4. Upstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 36°0 2´N, 51°14´ E, elevation 1887 m, near the village of
Kiasar.
Site 5. Upstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 36°02´N, 51°18´ E, elevation 2036 m, near the village of Kasil.
Site 6. Upstream of the Amir Kabir Dam, 36°07´N, 51°18´ E, elevation 2222 m, between the Gachsar and
Welayat Rud villages.

For collecting epipelic samples, a plastic syringe (with a capacity of 60 ml and diameter of 29.1 mm) with
the barrel cut off at the needle adapter end was inserted into the substrate. The plunger was pulled along the
barrel to admit 25 ml of the epipelic sample to flow in. The cut end of the syringe was then shut by means of a
spatula to transfer the sample into the preservative solution (4% formaldehyde, CH2O) in a 30 ml bottle.
Epilithic samples were collected from a rock by brushing 100 cm 2 of the rock surface. Material was
transferred into a 30 ml bottle containing the preservative solution and transported to the laboratory of Islamic
Azad University of Tehran. The samples were treated with 25–30 ml 30% hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) (1.5
hours at 100 °C) and then 10 ml hydrochloric acid (HCl) (2 hours at 120 °C) for the removal of organic matter
and carbonates. Excess acid was removed by repeated rinsing and settling with distilled water.
Coverslips were prepared with the diatom suspension and mounted on slides in Zrax. For LM images,
slides were examined using a Leica DMRB microscope under a 100x oil immersion objective (1.4 NA) with
differential interference contrast (DIC). Images were gathered and analyzed with a Qimaging 3.3 M camera
and software at the Iowa Lakeside Laboratory (Milford, Iowa, U.S.A.).
Cleaned material for SEM was placed on aluminum stubs and air dried. These stubs were coated with gold
(Emitech K550, 20 mA, 1.5 min) before being viewed using an LEO 440i scanning electron microscope
operated at 15 kV in the SEM center of the Islamic Azad University of Tehran Branch of Science and
Research. Additional SEM images were taken at the Wartburg College SEM Center (Waverly, Iowa, U.S.A)
using a Hitachi S-2460N SEM.
Comparison with Cyclotella delicatula Hustedt (1952: 376) was based on type material (BRM AC1/87,
holotype, AC1/88, AC1/89; see Simonsen 1987: 381 and Houk et al. 2010: 32, 292-299); comparison with C.
fotti Hustedt (in Huber-Pestalozzi 1942: 400) was based on Levkov et al. (2007) and Houk et al. (2010: 25,
224–229); comparison with C. krammeri Håkansson (1990: 263) was based on Håkansson (1990);
comparison with C. andancensis var. andancensis Ehrlich (1966: 316) was based on Ehrlich (1966) and
Serieyssol (1981); comparison with C. andancensis var. bauzilensis Serieyssol (1981: 29) and C. andancensis
var. bipolaira Serieyssol (1981: 31) was based on Serieyssol (1981). Additional taxonomic comparisons were
made using Krammer and Lange-Bertalot (1991).
Valve terminology follows Theriot & Serieyssol (1994) and Houk et al. (2010: 6). Stria density in 10 µm
was measured by counting the total striae on the disc face, dividing it by the circumference of the valve and
then multiplying that by 10.
Environmental factors, including dissolved oxygen (DO) and electrical conductivity (EC) of the water of
the river, were measured in situ with a portable DO meter (WTW Oxical-SL Model CellO×3205) and an EC
meter (Crison Model CM 35) respectively. Water samples were transported to the laboratory for further
analysis, with the results summarized in Table 3.

(not readily seen in LM); alveolar openings very short and small in relation to striae length (Figs 13–14). Stria
density 18–23 in 10 m; valve diameter varies from 5.5–15.8 m (Figs 2–10). Striae differ in length, arranged
in pseudo-sectored groups of branching striae around whole valve (Figs 11–12). 1–3 central fultoportulae
present, arranged randomly, mostly at proximal end of shorter striae (Fig. 4) or rarely at central end of a longer
stria (Figs 10, 5, 9). Central fultoportulae have two satellite pores and no ornamentation on external opening
of central tube. Marginal fultoportulae present on every third to sixth costae, near junction of valve face/
mantle (Figs 13–14). Marginal fultoportulae have two satellite pores, open to valve exterior through
unornamented central pore. One rimoportula situated on a costa between two adjacent foramina or, in larger
valves, slightly advalvar to a foramen (within the striated valve part); rimoportula observed only under SEM,
it is a sessile labium internally and variously oriented from radially to tangentially; external opening is a
simple unornamented pore (Figs 12–14).

Observations:—Among the many known species of Cyclotella, C. iranica is most similar to C.
delicatula (see Scheffler et al. 2003, Houk et al. 2010). Like C. iranica, C. delicatula has an irregular central
area with a similar valve diameter size range (Table 1). However, the central area in C. delicatula is more or
less transversally undulate and colliculate with pori or hollows. In contrast, C. iranica has a flat central area
without colliculae, pori or hollows (when seen in SEM). Moreover, granules are concentrically arranged in
rows on the costae of the valve view in C. delicatula, a feature that differentiates it from C. iranica (also in
SEM). The most distinctive difference between C. delicatula and C. iranica is that C. delicatula possesses 1-2
fultoportulae near the valve center, opposite the rimoportula (Houk et al. 2010, Scheffler et al. 2003, Kiss et
al. 2012). In C. iranica, there is one, or in larger valves, up to three, central fultoportulae situated near the
central end of a stria along the edge of the central area. Furthermore, the central area/valve diameter ratio in C.
iranica is less than that of C. delicatula.
Cyclotella iranica shares a similar stria pattern, central area and approximately similar central area/
diameter ratio with C. fottii (as in Levkov et al. 2007 and Houk et al. 2010) but Cyclotella iranica differs in
having a smaller, flat central area, stria density (in 10 m), valve diameter range and the presence of a central
fultoportula. C. iranica does not have marginal spines and its marginal fultoportulae are not visible in LM,
both of which are characters of C. fottii (Houk et al. 2010).

Cyclotella iranica can be compared to some Miocene fossil species such as C. andancensis, C.
andancensis var. bauzilensis and C. andancensis var. bipolaira (Ehrlich 1966, Serieyssol 1981). All of these
taxa share features with C. iranica, such as the unequal striated pattern of the valve, the presence of one
rimoportula, and its orientation, and the nearly similar central area/diameter. However, they all differ from C.
iranica by the absence of a central fultoportula and the colliculate ornamentation of central area. The alveolar
openings in C. andancensis var. andancensis are the same size as those found in C. iranica, but are different in
size when C. andancensis var. bauzilensis and C. andancensis var. bipolaira are compared with C. iranica.
Cyclotella krammeri (Håkansson 1990) is also similar to C. iranica in having an unequal striation to the
valve face, the presence of central fultoportulae and the size of alveolar openings. However, it has a larger
central area than C. iranica, with pori and papillae, and more central fultoportulae, which are located in the
center of the valve in contrast to C. iranica where the central fultoportulae are located at central end of striae.
Ecology and biogeography:—Habitat, Epipelic or epilithic. There is limited ecological and
biogeographical information on Cyclotella iranica as it is described here for the first time. From a
biogeographical standpoint, the distribution of Cyclotella iranica currently limited to the Karaj River basin in
Iran, its type locality. No other illustrations of this taxon have been located in the literature. Further efforts are
needed to determine if this taxon is indeed limited to just the Karaj Basin or if additional populations are to be
found throughout the Middle East.

Physicochemical factors taken in the field and laboratory (Table 3) suggest that Cyclotella iranica is
found in epipelic and epilithic collections from alkaline rivers, and that it is tolerant of nutrient and organic
enrichment as evidenced from the low dissolved oxygen and high BOD and COD of the type locality (Table
3). Among the sampling sites, C. iranica was found commonly only at Karaj River Sites 1 and 2 (Table 2).
There was no strong seasonality in the abundance of C. iranica as it was found at any time of the year; it was
most prevalent during the summer and fall months.
