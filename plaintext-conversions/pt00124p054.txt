Abstract
As part of the botanical and phytosociological characterisation of the Moqueguan flora, several Caryophyllaceae were
studied. A specimen that was collected from the Ubinas district is named Paronychia ubinensis (Caryophyllaceae:
Paronychioideae) and described as a new species. This species is compared with its closest relatives P. andina, P.
mandoniana, P. muschleri, P. peruviana and P. weberbaueri from Southern Peru.
Key words: Paronychia ubinensis, Caryophyllaceae, Paronychioideae, new species, Southern Peru

Introduction
Paronychia Miller (Bittrich 1993) consists of approximately 110 species worldwide (Chaudhri 1968, Kool
2012), 11 species and 7 subspecies are recorded from Peru (Macbride 1937; Brako & Zarucchi 1993). During a
study on the flora and vegetation of the Andean region of the department of Moquegua in southern Peru, more
than 1000 botanical specimens were collected. While identifying these collections several novelties were
discovered (Al-Shehbaz & Montesinos 2009, Montesinos 2012). One such species new to science is described
here and named Paronychia ubinensis. This species is similar to Paronychia andina A.Gray, P. mandoniana
Rohrb., P. muschlerii Chaudhri, P. peruviana Chaudhri and P. weberbaueri Chaudhri in habit and lifeform
characters, but differs in leaf and flower morphology. In P. ubinensis the leaves are much shorter, the ciliate hairs
on the leaf lamina and margins are absent, the ovary is shorter and the stigma is reduced to <0.1 mm in length.

acuminate, margin and tip with few minute bristle hairs, midrib with more bristle hairs than the lamina.
Leaves subglabrous, with few minute hirtella on the mucro. Bracts oblong-ovate, 1.2–2.0 mm x 0.8–1.5 mm,
slightly obtuse, with minute hirtella on margins and tip. Flowers few, 1.9–2.2 mm x 0.9–1.2 mm, glabrous and
urceolate; receptacle ovoid, whitish, 0.8–1 mm x 0.6–0.8 mm; sepals ovate, white, scarious, 1.6–1.8 mm x
0.8–1.4 mm, margins with <0.1 mm long white bristle hairs; petals dark red to purple, concave, 0.2–0.4 mm x
0.1–0.2 mm, urceolate, glabrous, base pale green; filaments 0.1-0.3 mm long; anthers 0.1–0.2 mm x 0.05–0.1
mm and pale green; ovary oblong, pale white, 0.6–0.8 x 0.6–0.8 mm; style <0.1 mm long, stigma
indistinctive. Fruit oblong-ovoid, 1-1.2 mm long, smooth, pale brown; seed c. 0.8-1 mm, subglobose to ovoid.
Ecology and distribution: Paronychia ubinensis grows mostly on rocky slopes and plateaus with bare
soils and is associated with chasmophyte vegetation. The plant was found at elevations of 4030–4500 m. This
species is endemic to Peru and is known thus far only from two collections from Moquegua.
Comparison: Paronychia ubinensis is closely related to the Andean Paronychia complex (Chaudhri
1968, MacBride 1937, Alvarez 2010, Kool 2012). The geographical parameters and habitats of Paronychia
andina A.Gray, P. mandoniana Rohrb., P. muschlerii Chaudhri, P. peruviana Chaudhri and P. weberbaueri
Chaudhri are similar to the newly described species. However, these species differ in morphological
characteristics, including leaves, flowers and ovary. Numerous herbarium specimens were examined from
USM, HUSA, MO, F, WAG and L. None of the described Andean species of Paronychia has internodes
shorter than 0.5 mm, the leaf shape linear to narrowly elliptic and size shorter than 2.2 mm, the sepals larger
than 1.6 mm and the ovary not larger than 0.8 mm, all characters in P. ubinensis. Therefore, P. ubinensis has
the shortest leaf size and larger ovary size of any known Andean Paronychia species. Another important
parameter is the absence of pubescence and bristle hairs on the leaves of P. ubinensis. Trichomes are only
present on the mucro; as opposed to the related Paronychia species, where pubescence in leaves and leaf
indument is common.

Paronychia ubinensis was also compared with the Paronychia species occurring in the Bolivian and
Chilean Andes, with which significant morphological and geographical differences were found. For instance,
P. communis Cambess. (Cabessèdes 1829), P. chilensis DC. (Candolle 1828), P. johnstonii Chaudhrii
(Chaudhri 1968) and P. setigera (Gillies) F. Herm (Hermann 1937) have larger leaf size (>5 mm) and
longitudinal separation of the glomerules (>1 cm), and form more prostrate plants inhabiting disturbed areas
in lower elevation regions. P. hieronymi Pax (Pax 1894) forms dense woody stems, its leaf size is larger and
has a pubescent surface, and it is restricted to Bolivia and Argentina. P. microphylla Phil. (Philippi 1891) is
characterized by a shrubby habit with larger leaf size and forms dense green glomerules, with a flower size

larger than 4 mm. Therefore, Paronychia ubinensis can be classified as one of the smallest species from the
Andean group.
According to Alvarez (2010), the genus Paronychia is polyphyletic and Paronychia andina and
Paronychia weberbaueri form a clade. It is unlikely that the Andean Paronychia species form a monophyletic
group (pers. comm. Anneleen Kool).
Etymology: The specific epithet of the new species refers to the endemism in the Ubinas district, in the
Moquegua department, southern Peru.
