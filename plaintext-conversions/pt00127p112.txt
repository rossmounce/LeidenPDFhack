Abstract
Specimens of the Neogene marine diatom Thalassiosira dolmatovae have been studied with a scanning
electron microscope for the first time. The observations revealed the morphological features typical of this
species including arrangement of different kinds of processes. T. dolmatovae has one single subcentral strutted
process, a ring of marginal strutted processes, a labiate process located at the margin and enclosed by two
strutted processes. Marginal strutted processes with outward extensions and without inward extensions have
internal openings surrounded by 4 satellite pores. The location of a labiate process not on the valve face and
the presence of marginal strutted processes with outward extensions indicate that the studied species really
belongs to genus Thalassiosira not to genus Shionodiscus. A valid description of T. dolmatovae is given.

Introduction
The diatom species Thalassiosira dolmatovae was described (but as a nodem nudum, see below) from the
Neogene of Karaginsky Island stratigraphic section, northeastern Kamchatka (Fig. 1), by T. Oreshkina (1992)
based on material studied with a light microscope (LM). Stratigraphic and paleontological data of the last two
decades indicate this fossil diatom is typical of the Neogene marine onshore sequences from Kamchatka and
Alaska (Oreshkina 1992; Dolmatova 1992a, b; Marincovich & Gladenkov 1999, 2001; Gladenkov 2003,
2006). Similar taxa are also known to be typical of the Neogene sequences from Sakhalin, Japan, California,
and bottom sediments from the North Pacific. Morphology and taxonomy of a number of taxa from oceanic
sediments have been studied in detail with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) by Bodén (1993), Shiono
(2000, 2001) and Shiono & Koizumi (2000, 2001). As a result, the revision of some species has been carried
out and several new species and forms from genus Thalassiosira Cleve (1873: 6) have been described based on
a location of rimoportula (labiate process), number and arrangement of fultoportula (strutted processes),
structure of strutted processes (operculate, or trifultate), possession of occluded processes, and a presence of
central occluded areolae. The stratigraphic occurrence of these new taxa and related species in the northwest
Pacific has been also clarified. The obtained results allowed distinguishing Thalassiosira trifulta G. Fryxell in
Fryxell & Hasle (1979: 16–19) group with a definition of its three different subgroups, and speculation on the
phylogenic evolution of the group (Shiono & Koizumi 2000, 2001).
Data on the stratigraphic occurrence of T. dolmatovae indicates this species is a potential biostratigraphic
marker for the uppermost Miocene to upper Pliocene sequences in Alaska and Kamchatka ranging within the
interval corresponding to the North Pacific Neodenticula kamtschatica (Zabelina) Akiba & Yanagisawa
(1986: 490–491) diatom Zone to Neodenticula koizumii Akiba & Yanagisawa (1986: 491) Zone (Oreshkina
1992; Dolmatova 1992a, b; Gladenkov et al. 2002; Gladenkov 2003, 2006). However, detailed morphological
features of T. dolmatovae including different types of processes, their structure and arrangement remained

unknown because they had never been observed by means of SEM. In order to bridge a gap and compare them
with resembling taxa, specimens of T. dolmatovae have been studied with SEM for the first time. Moreover,
the original description of T. dolmatovae by Oreshkina (1992) is invalid because it lacks a holotype, thus the
valid description of this taxa should be given.

dolmatovae is documented. 1—Karaginsky Island section, northeastern Kamchatka. 2—Sandy Ridge section, the Alaska Peninsula,

Materials and Methods
Specimens of T. dolmatovae derived from the samples collected from the Neogene Milky River Formation at
the Sandy Ridge stratigraphic section of the Alaska Peninsula, southwestern Alaska were studied (Figs. 1, 2).
As it was shown by results obtained on diatom stratigraphy (Gladenkov 2003, 2006), T. dolmatovae is typical
of fossil diatom assemblages from the Milky River Formation occurring consistently and relatively
abundantly through the section with an age range of ~5.5 to 4.8 Ma (Figs. 2, 3). Sample material (#CAS
608382, CAS 608400, and CAS 60269-s) is deposited at Geological Institute of Russian Academy of
Sciences, Moscow, Russia, and duplicates of strewn slides are deposited at the California Academy of
Sciences, San Francisco, USA.

Occurrence:—Marine neritic species. Marine deposits of the latest Miocene to early Pliocene (the North
Pacific Neodenticula kamtschatica diatom Zone) of the Alaska Peninsula, southwestern Alaska; the latest
Miocene to late Pliocene (the Neodenticula kamtschatica Zone to Neodenticula koizumii Zone) of Karaginsky
Island, northeastern Kamchatka.
Remarks:—This species is distinguished from Thalassiosira baldaufii Bodén (1993: 68) by the presence
of one single central strutted process on the valve face, by the absence of prominent marginal occluded
processes, and by areolae pattern. It is similar to Thalassiosira labimarginata Bodén (1993: 68) but differs by
larger valve diameter, wider hyaline margin, and size of areolae and their arrangement.
Etymology:—The species is named in honour of Dr. Lora M. Dolmatova who studied fossil diatoms from
Russian Far East during many years.

Observations
Specimens of T. dolmatovae from Alaskan material have circular valves, varying from slightly convex to
almost flat (Figs. 4–11, 14–17), with a diameter ranging between 12 and 37 µm, the majority of observed
specimens with diameters around 18–30 µm. Areolae on valve face showing a rounded-polygonal image in
LM with an irregular arrangement to concentrically wavy rows (Figs. 4–8). On the valve face size of the
areolae gradually decrease from the centre (3–5 areolae in 10 µm), with an abrupt change in the size of areolae
in the submerginal zone approximately from the boundary between valve face and low mantle where up to
19–25 areolae in 10 µm near the margin are arranged in sublinear to tangental rows (Figs. 9, 15–17, 28, 29).
The internal cribra of areolae seems to be subcircular in outline (Figs. 12, 13), but as a rule cribra is eroded.
Most of specimens have external bulges between areolae giving to valve face a relief undulate image in SEM
(Figs. 14, 15, 17). In some cases small rounded openings are observed at the top of these projections (Figs. 17,
28) which may be regarded as simple external (occluded) processes. Margin is hyaline, 0.7–1.5 µm wide.

One single strutted process occurs somewhat away from the valve center between two areolae, closer to
the areola having a smaller size than other central areolae (Figs. 4, 6, 9, 10). Central fultoportula has no
external extension and discernible as a small rounded opening on the outside of the valve (Figs. 9, 10, 17, 19,
21, 23). Internal opening has the form of slightly raised rim surrounded by 4 satellite pores (Figs. 20, 24, 25,
27). To a certain extent the smaller areolae closer to central strutted process bears resemblance to the
internally occluded “occluded areolae” defined by Shiono (2000, 2001). In contrast to external view of valves,
internal view of T. dolmatovae shows the absence of internal opening of this areolae but the presence of dark
circle looks like the occluded areolae (Figs. 18, 22).
Four to 6 strutted processes in 10 µm separated by 3–4 areolae are located at the submarginal zone and
positioned at approximately the same distance from the margin near the boundary between the valve face and
the mantle where the size of areolae decreases abruptly (Figs. 14, 15, 20, 22, 25–27, 29). The fultoportula’s
internal openings in the form of slightly raised rims surrounded by 4 satellite pores are observed on the inside
of the valve (Figs. 20, 25, 27). Strutted processes have external extensions discernible as knob-like projections
with small rounded openings on their tops (Figs. 14, 15, 28, 29). Previously these projections have been
regarded as marginal occluded processes by the author (Gladenkov 2010). However, additional study and
discussions with colleagues at the 21st International Diatom Symposium held in 2010 allow recognizing them
as external extensions of marginal strutted processes. One single labiate process with internal radially oriented
slit and on a short stalk is located at the margin and enclosed by two strutted processes (Figs. 20, 24–26).
Externally, the rimoportula appears as a small rounded opening indistinguishable from the areolae. Morphology
of the girdle region was not studied, although the copula slitted near the whereabouts of labiate process, and
radially “ribbed” copula were observed occasionally on the inside of the valve (Figs. 20, 24, 25, 27).

Discussion
The presence of structure looks like the “occluded areolae” defined by Shiono (2000, 2001) in the valve centre
of T. dolmatovae is quite surprise. As showed Shiono & Koizumi (2001) occluded areolae (or pore-like
structure) are typical of only their Thalassiosira bipora Shiono (2000: 139) subgroup from Thalassiosira
trifulta group. This subgroup comprises of taxa lacking external spines and projections, and having a labiate
process located on the valve face. Recently these and related taxa with a rimoportula being distant from the
margin, and with long inward and reduced or absent outward extensions, have been transferred from genus
Thalassiosira to new genus Shionodiscus A.J. Alverson, S.-H. Kang & E.C. Theriot (2006: 258). However,
occluded areolae were unknown for Thalassiosia species having a labiate process located not onto valve face
and external projections as T. dolmatovae does. So probably, T. dolmatovae is the first example of possession
of all these morphological features, and its possible relation with “Thalassiosira bipora” subgroup may be
speculated in the future.
Comparison. T. dolmatovae is distinguished from specimens of T. baldaufii Bodén by the presence of one
single central strutted process on the valve face, by the absence of prominent marginal occluded processes,
and by areolae pattern. It differs from T. labimarginata Bodén by larger valve diameter, wider hyaline margin,
and size of areolae and their arrangement. On an abrupt decrease in the size of areolae at the submarginal zone
T. dolmatovae resembles some taxa from genus Shionodiscus Alverson, Kang et Theriot (previously attributed
to genus Thalassiosira), namely Shionodiscus biporus (Shiono) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006: 259), S.
centrus (Shiono) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006: 259), S. depressus (Shiono) Alverson, Kang et Theriot
(2006: 259), S. exceptiunculus (Shiono) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006: 259), S. frenguelliopsis (Fryxell et
Johansen) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006: 259), S. tetraoestrupii (Bodén) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006:
260), and S. tetraoestrupii var. reimeri (Mahood et Barron) Alverson, Kang et Theriot (2006: 260). However,
in contrast to Shionodiscus taxa T. dolmatovae has marginal strutted processes with outward extensions, a
labiate process located at the margin, and occluded processes scattered on the valve face. Thus, T. dolmatovae
can not be transferred from genus Thalassiosira to genus Shionodiscus.

Distribution. T. dolmatovae is known from the latest Miocene to late Pliocene marine neritic diatom
assemblages of northeastern Kamchatka (Oreshkina 1992, Dolmatova 1992a, b) and latest Miocene to early
Pliocene assemblages of southwestern Alaska (Gladenkov et al. 2002; Gladenkov 2003, 2006). Resembling
taxa referred to as Thalassiosira cf. tetraoestrupii var. reimeri Mahood et Barron was also documented from
the latest Miocene to late Pliocene of southern Sakhalin and northern Hokkaido (Akiba et al 2000). Notable,
in Northern Hokkaido area it occurs commonly to abundantly just around the boundary between Neodenticula
kamtschiatica Zone and Neodenticula koizumii–Neodenticula kamtschatica Zone, just like a short but very
remarkable marker bed (Akiba, personal communication 2010). Moreover, specimens similar to T.
dolmatovae under LM and referred to as Thalassiosira sp. 2 were noted and illustrated from deposits assigned
to the uppermost Miocene–lower Pliocene in borehole А–2 drilled in Aiyon Island, the East Siberian Sea
(Stepanova 1989). However, further study of mentioned taxa under SEM should finally clarify their
taxonomic position because the location of labiate process, the number and structure of strutted processes
(operculate, or trifultate) and other morphological features are unknown for the present.

Conclusions
The original description of T. dolmatovae by T. Oreshkina (1992, p. 129) based only on LM observation is in
Russian. My English translation of the diagnosis is as follows: “Valve circular, flat, diameter 15–20 µm.
Areolae are in rarefied concentrically wavy rows, 3–4 areolae in 10 µm in the valve center, near the margin
areolae are considerable smaller, 10–12 in 10 µm. One or several strutted processes are in the center. Distinct
marginal strutted processes are located at the boundary between valve face and mantle, 4–5 in 10 µm. Margin
hyaline, 2–3 µm in wide”. However, data obtained with SEM revealed only subcentral strutted process not
“several strutted processes in the center”. Possibly, combinations of central strutted process and the nearest
areolae of relatively small size, or central fultoportula and adjacent external processes have been interpreted
as “central strutted processes” under LM. Also SEM observation shows the presence of simple external
(occluded) processes scattered on the valve face. These processes have not been noted in the original
description but the presence of “mucous pores” scattered on the whole valve face was mentioned by L.
Dolmatova (1992b, p. 86) in her informal description of Thalassiosira sp. 9 that is a synonym of T.
dolmatovae. Moreover, SEM study revealed smaller sizes of areolae near the margin (up to 19–25 areolae in
10 µm) in comparison with those from the original description (10–12 in 10 µm) and the informal description
by Dolmatova (1992b)—up to 15 in 10 µm. Additionally, data obtained with SEM revealed narrower hyaline
margin (0.7–1.5 µm wide) in comparison with the original description (2–3 µm). However, measurements
including width of copulae and/or valvocopula instead of a real margin under LM may have been included and
influence the earlier descriptions.
It is important to emphasize that unfortunately, the first species description of Thalassiosira dolmatovae
Oreshkina is invalid because the rubric “Holotype” is absent and the holotype for the species is not designated
in the original description (Oreshkina 1992, p. 192). According to the International Code of Botanical
Nomenclature, even in 1992 it was compulsory to designate holotypes in descriptions of new species. Hence,
instead of T. dolmatovae Oreshkina, a new species based on a valid description must be erected. The original
description is supplemented with SEM observations, but I retain the name Thalassiosira dolmatovae for this
new taxon in honour of Russian diatomologist Lora M. Dolmatova, who found it for the first time in
Kamchatka but did not publish its formal description.
