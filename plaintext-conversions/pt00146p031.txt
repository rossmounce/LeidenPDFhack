Abstract
The generic taxonomy of the Nothofagaceae is revised. We present a new phylogenetic analysis of morphological
characters and map these characters onto a recently published phylogenetic tree obtained from DNA sequence data.
Results of these and previous analyses strongly support the monophyly of four clades of Nothofagaceae that are currently
treated as subgenera of Nothofagus. The four clades of Nothofagaceae are robust and well-supported, with deep stem
divergences, have evolutionary equivalence with other genera of Fagales, and can be circumscribed with morphological
characters. We argue that these morphological and molecular differences are sufficient for the four clades of
Nothofagaceae to be recognised at the primary rank of genus, and that this classification will be more informative and
efficient than the currently circumscribed Nothofagus with four subgenera.
Nothofagus is recircumscribed to include five species from southern South America, Lophozonia and Trisyngyne are
reinstated, and the new genus Fuscospora is described. Fuscospora and Lophozonia, with six and seven species
respectively, occur in New Zealand, southern South America and Australia. Trisyngyne comprises 25 species from New
Caledonia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. New combinations are provided where necessary in each of these genera.
Key words: DNA sequence data, Fagales, generic names, genus concept, new combinations

Introduction
The genus Nothofagus Blume (1851: 307) as it is currently circumscribed comprises 42 species of deciduous
and evergreen forest trees that have a disjunct Southern Hemisphere distribution. Species occur in South
America (south-western Argentina and Chile), Australia (south-eastern Australia and Tasmania), New
Zealand, New Guinea (Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and also New Britain and the D’Entrecasteaux

Archipelago), and New Caledonia. The genus also has an abundant fossil record (e.g. Hill 1991, 2001) and is
well-represented by pollen that first appeared in the early Campanian of the Late Cretaceous (83.5 mya;
Dettmann et al. 1990). Pollen and macrofossil records both indicate that Nothofagus occurred throughout
much of southern Gondwana before the breakup of that continent. The widespread distribution and excellent
fossil record of Nothofagus have resulted in the genus being a key focus of Southern Hemisphere
biogeographic research (e.g., Steenis 1971, Humphries 1981, Tanai 1986, Pole 1994, Linder & Crisp 1995,
McGlone et al. 1996, Ladiges et al. 1997, Manos 1997, Sanmartín & Ronquist 2004, Knapp et al. 2005).
The current infrageneric taxonomy of Nothofagus is now well-established and was erected by Hill & Read
(1991). These authors divided the genus into four subgenera: subgenus Brassospora Philipson & Philipson
(1988: 34), subgenus Fuscospora Hill & Read (1991: 69), subgenus Lophozonia (Turczaninow 1858: 396)
Krasser (1896: 162), and the autonym subgenus Nothofagus. This infrageneric classification superseded those
of Steenis (1953a) and Philipson & Philipson (1988), classifications that were primarily based on a deciduous
or evergreen habit, cupule morphology and leaf vernation and did not incorporate pollen morphology,
although an informal taxonomic classification of extant and fossil species based on pollen groupings was
being used by palynologists (Cookson 1952, Cookson & Pike 1955, Stover & Evans 1973). Hill & Read
(1991) based their subgeneric classification on a thorough synthesis of the morphology of the leaves
(including hairs and stomata), pollen and fruiting cupules. There have also been additional studies that have
provided detailed analyses of the floral characters of Nothofagus, including staminate (Rozefelds 1998,
Rozefelds & Drinnan 1998) and pistillate (Rozefelds & Drinnan 2002) flower morphology. Some of these
floral characters provide support for the infrageneric taxonomy of Hill & Read (1991), but they need to be
integrated with the data used by Manos (1997), Hill & Jordan (1993), and Jordan & Hill (1999) in a new
phylogenetic analysis of morphological characters.
DNA sequence data have also played an important role in unravelling the evolutionary history and
taxonomy of Nothofagus. Martin & Dowd (1993) examined the phylogeny of Nothofagus species using the
chloroplast rbcL gene. They included good sampling of all the Nothofagus subgenera of Hill & Read (1991)
and recovered clades entirely consistent with their classification, albeit with limited bootstrap support for
most clades. Both the monophyly of the Nothofagus subgenera and the relationships among them reported by
Martin & Dowd (1993) were later confirmed for another chloroplast marker (the atpB–rbcL intergenic spacer)
by Setoguchi et al. (1997) using a similar selection of taxa. More significantly, Manos (1997) recovered
congruent results using nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS spacer sequences and complementary taxon sampling to
Martin & Dowd (1993), and provided a combined analysis of ITS data with the rbcL sequences of the earlier
authors. Further, consistent DNA phylogenetic analyses have been published by Knapp et al. (2005) and
Premoli et al. (2011), although neither of these studies sampled Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora. Most
recently, Sauquet et al. (2012) conducted Maximum Likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis of available atpB,
rbcL, atpB–rbcL intergenic spacer, trnL intron, trnL–trnF intergenic spacer and ITS sequences and recovered
a phylogeny in which 11 clades received 95% or greater bootstrap support. These included clades equivalent
to each of the Nothofagus subgenera and clades consistent with the relationships among them indicated by
previous DNA studies: (Lophozonia (Fuscospora (Brassospora, Nothofagus))).
While the monophyly of each of the Nothofagus subgenera of Hill & Read (1991) and the relationships
among them are overwhelmingly supported by DNA sequence data, relationships of species within the
subgenera must be considered with caution. There is incongruence among chloroplast and nuclear DNA data
sets (Manos 1997), and trans-specific chloroplast DNA polymorphism involving plastid lineages evidently
older than the radiation of extant species most probably results from chloroplast capture (Acosta & Premoli
2010, Premoli et al. 2011).
Molecular clock dating using DNA sequence data is consistent with the fossil history of Nothofagus
(Cook & Crisp 2005, Sauquet et al. 2012). The Nothofagus subgeneric lineages diverged in the Senonian
(upper Cretaceous) and Eocene (Tertiary), with stem ages derived from Beast analyses of 72.1 (95%
confidence intervals of 53.4–93.2) mya for Lophozonia, 52.8 (36.5–70.6) mya for Fuscospora, and 42.2
(31.5–56.4) mya for Nothofagus and Brassospora (Sauquet et al. 2012, fig. 2). Crown ages date from the

middle Eocene and Oligocene, with Lophozonia diversifying at 42.0 (31.5–59.3) mya, Fuscospora at 30.0
(10.9–49.5) mya, Brassospora at 26.1 (13.9–38.9) mya, and Nothofagus at 24.4 (11.1–39.8) mya (Sauquet et
al. 2012, fig. 2).
Subsequent to the publication of Hill & Read’s (1991) subgeneric classification, DNA sequence studies
have also clarified the relationship of Nothofagus to other genera of Fagales. Importantly, a close relationship
with Fagaceae, and in particular a sister group relationship between Fagus and Nothofagus (Kubitzki 1993),
has been rejected and Nothofagus has instead been shown to be the sister group of the remaining extant
Fagales (Manos & Steele 1997, Li et al. 2004, Sauquet et al. 2012), and consequently is now placed in the
monogeneric Nothofagaceae (Kuprianova 1962, APG 2009). Morphological and anatomical studies (Crepet
& Daghlian 1980, Nixon 1982, 1989, Jones 1986, Zheng et al. 1999, Li et al. 2004) support the recognition of
Nothofagaceae. The family Nothofagaceae is therefore used in this paper and a revised family description is
presented in the Taxonomy section.
It has now been over 20 years since the widely used Nothofagus subgeneric taxonomy was erected by Hill
& Read (1991), and given the significant amount of new data from morphology and DNA sequences it is
timely to reassess the classification and the appropriateness of the subgeneric rank. An alternative
classification of the Nothofagaceae could recognise well-supported clades at generic rank, most obviously by
raising the subgenera to generic rank. To evaluate the classification of Nothofagaceae in this paper we provide
a synthesis of the heterogeneous body of molecular and morphological evidence and undertake a new
phylogenetic analysis of the morphological data. To provide a measure of evolutionary equivalence for
interpreting these studies in regard to the generic circumscription of Nothofagus, we undertake a comparative
study of genetic variation at generic rank in Nothofagaceae and five other families (Betulaceae,
Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae and Myricaceae) of the order Fagales. Furthermore, to provide
consistency in the application of morphological characters to generic circumscription, we also review the
characters used in recognising three recently named new genera in the Fagaceae (Nixon & Crepet 1989,
Manos et al. 2008).
Criteria for recognising genera
Linder et al. (2010) identified two categories of criteria for the circumscription of genera. Category 1 consists
of criteria that pertain to the delimitation of the clades, and category 2 consists of criteria that pertain to the
ranking of the clades. Like Backlund & Bremer (1998) and many other authors, Linder et al. (2010) explicitly
place category 1 above category 2, preferring that the criterion of monophyly should first be met by any
candidate taxon. We concur that monophyly is a desirable characteristic of taxa and that classification systems
should seek to maximise the recognition of well-supported monophyletic groups. Because many aspects of the
phylogeny of the Nothofagaceae are well-known and straightforward, the criterion of monophyly can be met
without unduly sacrificing other criteria. The specific criteria we adopt for category 1 are that: 1—clades
received bootstrap support 95% or greater in the analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012); 2—clades are able to be
defined by morphological synapomorphies.
Considering Linder et al. (2010) and also Backlund & Bremer (1998) we adopt the following criteria for
the ranking of clades (category 2).
1. Primary taxonomic ranks (e.g. family, genus, species) as defined in the International Code of
Nomenclature (ICN; McNeill et al. 2012) should be used first in a classification, and secondary ranks (e.g.
subgenus) used as required.
2. Classifications should maximise phylogenetic information and minimise redundancy.
3. Taxonomic ranks should reflect evolutionarily-equivalent groups. This encompasses clade age, genetic
distance, and morphological diversity. We acknowledge this can be difficult to achieve and needs to
consider contemporary use of ranks in related taxa.
4. Ideally, genera will be morphologically homogeneous.
5. For the sake of users and nomenclatural stability name changes should be minimised, but consideration
should also be given to the full taxonomic history of a group and not just the last revision.

Material and methods
Morphological phylogeny and character evolution
We present two phylogenetic analyses of morphological data. In Analysis 1, we reanalyse the morphological
data of Jordan & Hill (1999), with the addition of characters from other studies (e.g. Hill & Read 1991, Manos
1997, Rozefelds 1998, Rozefelds & Drinnan 1998, 2002, Jordan & Hill 1999). We also add three characters
for the presence or absence of three Cyttaria (Berkeley 1842: 40) lineages documented in Peterson et al.
(2010). Character 10 of Jordan & Hill (1999)—pollen equatorial diameter—was omitted because the coding
used therein does not agree with the data presented in Praglowski (1982). Character 11 (wood anatomy,
tracheids present or absent; Jordan & Hill 1999) was also removed due to criticism by Rozefelds (1998) and
Rozefelds & Drinnan (2002). The characters scored are listed in Appendix 1, and the morphological matrix is
presented in Appendix 2. Analysis 1 was conducted with the heuristic search option of PAUP* 4.0b10.1
(Swofford 2002), treating all characters as unordered and using default settings. Bootstrap scores were
calculated from 100 replicates using full heuristic searches.
The phylogenetic analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012) is the most thorough undertaken to date and comprises
a maximum likelihood (ML) analysis of combined sequence data from six regions of the chloroplast and
nuclear genomes. The tree derived from this ML analysis identified 11 well-supported clades of Nothofagus
including clades equivalent to the subgenera Brassospora, Fuscospora, Lophozonia and Nothofagus. For
Analysis 2, we mapped the morphological characters from Analysis 1 onto a tree constrained to match those
branches supported by ≥ 95% bootstrap in the Sauquet et al. (2012) analysis, with the aim of identifying
morphological characters supporting those clades, using MacClade 4.03 (Maddison & Maddison 2001).
For both analyses we used two outgroups—Betulaceae and Fagus Linnaeus (1753: 997–998)—both
representatives of the sister group to Nothofagaceae (being the clade encompassing the other families of
Fagales) and each having been used in previous cladistic analyses of the family using morphological
characters (Hill & Jordan 1993, Manos 1997, Jordan & Hill 1999). Character coding for outgroups was based
on these previous studies and information from Praglowski (1982), Dengler & MacKay (1975) and Denk
(2003).
Evolutionary equivalence
Comparison of rbcL variation in families of Fagales
In order to provide a measure of evolutionary equivalence and taxonomic diversity and to be consistent in the
application of generic circumscription in Nothofagaceae in comparison with genera in other families of the
Fagales, we undertook an analysis of DNA sequence variation among genera of the Betulaceae,
Casuarinaceae, Fagaceae, Juglandaceae and Myricaceae. Nothofagaceae are represented in this analysis by (a)
the genus Nothofagus and (b) the four Nothofagus subgenera. The chloroplast gene rbcL is well-sampled
across these families and so we used this locus to estimate genetic distances within and among genera. We
used MEGA 5.05 (Tamura et al. 2011) to align all the rbcL sequences available at the time in GenBank
(totalling 445) and generated a Neighbour-Joining tree using Jukes-Cantor distances. Using this tree as a
guide we selected 161 representative sequences covering the phylogenetic diversity of each genus and
reducing the level of redundancy in taxon coverage. Sequences were then grouped according to family and
genera and genetic distances computed using the p-distance model. The data were subjected to the ML
molecular clock test implemented in MEGA. The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used are
provided in Appendix 3.
Morphology of new genera in Fagaceae
Three new genera in Fagaceae have recently been described. Formanodendron Nixon & Crepet (1989: 840)
and Colombobalanus Nixon & Crepet (1989: 840–841) are monotypic genera segregated from the now
monotypic Trigonobalanus Forman (1962: 140). The monotypic Notholithocarpus Manos, Cannon & Oh
(2008: 188) was segregated from Lithocarpus Blume (1826: 526). We review the morphological characters

used to circumscribe these genera, and compare these characters and their variation to similar characters in
Nothofagaceae.

Results
Category 1 criteria—circumscribing clades
A heuristic search of the morphological character matrix in PAUP 3.1 (Analysis 1) found 12 most
parsimonious trees with a length of 84 steps, consistency index 0.679, rescaled consistency index 0.599, and
retention index of 0.883. These trees featured four main clades (Fig. 1) corresponding to the four Nothofagus
subgenera and indicating that each of these is monophyletic. Nothofagus subgenus Lophozonia appears as
sister group to the remainder of the family and Nothofagus subgenus Nothofagus is sister group to a clade
composed of Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora and Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora. The strict consensus
tree along with bootstrap support values is shown in Figure 1.

Fuscospora (Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora), Lophozonia (Nothofagus subgenus Lophozonia), Nothofagus (Nothofagus subgenus

We traced morphological character evolution onto a tree constrained by a 95% bootstrap consensus tree
based on the DNA phylogeny of Sauquet et al. (2012) (Analysis 2; Fig. 2). This identified unique
morphological synapomorphies for eight of the 11 clades supported by 95% bootstrap or greater as detailed
below. Our analysis did not identify unique morphological synapomorphies for three clades that were wellsupported in the DNA sequence analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012). These clades were the one combining the
South American species of Nothofagus subgenus Lophozonia, one combining N. menziesii and N. moorei, and
a clade comprising the Australian and New Zealand members of Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora.

subgenus Nothofagus), and Trisyngyne (Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora).

Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora
Analysis 2 suggested six unique synapomorphies for subgenus Brassospora (Fig. 2). These are character 1,
state 3: leaf vernation conduplicate; character 9, state 2: pollen aperture rimmed; character 24, state 1:
filaments connate; character 30, state 2: staminate perianth tubular; character 32, state 2: anther distal
connective protrusion strongly developed; and character 33, state 2: cupule glabrous.
For character 2, subgenus Brassospora is unique in presenting character states 1 (valves 2, fruit 3
dimerous) and 2 (valves 2, fruit 1 dimerous). Manos (1997) interpreted the dimerous flowers as a bicarpellate
synapomorphy for subgenus Brassospora. Character 18, state 0 (giant stomata present) is also optimised as a
synapomorphy for subgenus Brassospora, but giant stomata also occur in N. cunninghamii (Hooker 1840:
152, t. 7) Ørsted (1871: 355) of subgenus Lophozonia and in the outgroups. Character 19, state 0 (stomatal
size more or less even excluding giant stomata) is also optimised as a synapomorphy for subgenus
Brassospora, but this condition occurs in N. dombeyi (Mirbel 1827: 467, t. 24) Ørsted (1871: 354) and N.
nitida (Philippi 1858: 44) Krasser (1896: 163) of subgenus Nothofagus and in Fagus. Character 20, state 2
(upper epidermal cells over veins thinner than areolar cells) is unique to subgenus Brassospora but in N.
perryi Steenis (1952a: 146) is reversed to state 1 (upper epidermal cells over veins not distinguishable from
areolar cells). Within Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora, the New Caledonian species (N. aequilateralis and
N. balansae) share the unique synapomorphies of character 5, state 0: cupule valves woody, and character 11,
state 1: phyllotaxy spiral.
Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora
Only one unambiguous and unique synapomorphy for subgenus Fuscospora was suggested by Analysis 2
(Fig. 2). This is character 9, state 1 (pollen aperture with heavy thickening).
One additional character is a potential syapomorphy. Character 13, state 1 (unicellular trichome type A
absent) was optimised as synapomorphic for Fuscospora in Analysis 2 and is unique in Nothofagaceae, but
also occurs in Fagus.
Nothofagus subgenus Lophozonia
Unambiguous and unique synapomorphies supporting the monophyly of subgenus Lophozonia are (Fig. 2):
character 6, state 1: staminate flowers pseudanthium present; character 9, state 3: pollen aperture unthickened;
character 25, state 1: usually > 20 stamens (sometimes with < 20 stamens in N. cunninghamii); character 30,
state 1: perianth open and broadly campanulate; and character 37, state 1: Cyttaria lineage C present.
Four further characters are potentially synapomorphies of subgenus Lophozonia but because they were
not scored or are polymorphic in the outgroups they can be optimised equally parsimoniously as
synapomorphies for the other three subgenera combined. These potential synapomorphies are character 3,
state 1: cupule with glandular lamellae; character 26, state 1: pollen aperture ends V-shaped; character 28,
state 1: stamen development pseudocentrifugal; and character 33, state 1: outer surface of valves densely
covered with simple trichomes.
Within this clade the evergreen species [N. cunninghamii, N. menziesii (Hooker 1844: t. 652) Ørsted
(1871: 355), and N. moorei (Mueller 1866: 109) Krasser (1896: 161)] are characterised by the unique
synapomorphy of broad-based conical trichomes; character 15, state 2.
Nothofagus subgenus Nothofagus
Analysis 2 suggested two unambiguous and unique synapomorphies for subgenus Nothofagus (Fig. 2). These
are character 16, state 1 (stomates with thickened T-pieces of cuticle at the poles) and character 17, state 1
(stomatal orientation mostly parallel with the midrib).
One additional character is a potential synapomorphy. Character 35 state 1 (Cyttaria lineage A present)
was optimised as a unique synapomorphy for subgenus Nothofagus, but has been lost in N. nitida.

Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora + subgenus Brassospora + subgenus Nothofagus
Unambiguous and unique synapomorphies supporting the monophyly of this clade are character 34, state 0:
pollen aperture length 4–11 µm; character 29, state 0: staminate perianth lobe number 4; character 14, state 1:
solitary unicellular trichome type C absent; and character 8, state 1: pollen equatorial diameter l/E < 0.3. In
addition, there are the four ambiguously optimised character state changes described above as possible
synapomorphies for subgenus Lophozonia that could be synapomorphies for this clade with equal parsimony.
Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora + subgenus Nothofagus
A single synapomorphy was identified by Analysis 2 for this clade. This was character 10, state 1: stipule
attachment peltate.

Category 2 criteria—ranking the clades
Comparison of rbcL variation in families of Fagales
DNA-sequence-based genetic distances can provide a useful guide to the range of phylogenetic diversity
represented by taxa. Although we do not suggest that in isolation genetic distances are an appropriate measure
for determining taxonomic rank, they can be used to assess evolutionary equivalence and can be considered
along with other data in the decision-making process. We used genetic distances at the chloroplast rbcL locus
to compare the level of genetic diversity within Nothofagus and its subgenera with genetic diversity within
and among genera in other families of the Fagales. While a strict molecular clock can be confidently rejected
for the Fagales rbcL data we have analysed (P < 0.0001), examination of phylograms suggests that the level
of variation in substitution rate is not so great as to entirely invalidate such a comparison.
By far the greatest phylogenetic diversity (as estimated from rbcL sequences) of any family in the order
Fagales is found in Fagaceae (Table 1). Most of this diversity is captured by the division of the family into two
clades corresponding with Fagus on the one hand and the remaining genera on the other. Net p-distance
between Fagus and the other genera ranges from 0.029 to 0.035. Within the non-Fagus clade, Chrysolepis
Hjelmquist (1948: 117) rbcL sequences differ by p-distances between 0.011 and 0.014 from the other genera.
P-distances among the sequences of Castanopsis (Don 1825: 56) Spach (1841: 185), Castanea Miller (1754:
278), Lithocarpus, Quercus Linnaeus (1753: 993–997), and Trigonobalanus are all 0.005 or less. The greatest
rbcL sequence diversity within a genus in the Fagales (excluding Nothofagus) is found in Fagus (Fagaceae)
with rbcL p-distances of up to 0.017 between species.
Sequence diversity of rbcL within Nothofagaceae (with Nothofagus as the sole genus) is nearly twice as
great as for Fagus at 0.030 (Table 1). Even with the four Nothofagus subgenera treated as four genera as
proposed in this paper, rbcL p-distances within them would range from 0.015 to 0.018 (ie, from slighly less to
slightly more than within Fagus). The net rbcL p-distances among the four proposed genera of Nothofagus range
from 0.006 to 0.011, well above the minimum distances observed among genera in all the other Fagales families.

Morphology of new genera in Fagaceae
Three new genera have recently been described in the Fagaceae (Nixon & Crepet 1989, Manos et al. 2008),
and analysis of these provides a useful comparative framework in which to evaluate generic circumscription
in Nothofagaceae. Formanodendron and Colombobalanus are monotypic genera segregated from the now
monotypic Trigonobalanus, and these collectively form a monophyletic clade (Nixon & Crepet 1989). When
placed in Trigonobalanus, the three species are united by characters such as valved cupules, flowers and fruits
more than one per cupule, fruit triangular and often winged, and epigeal germination. However, the three
species were each placed in monotypic genera as they have characters unique in the Fagaceae. These unique
characters include whorled or alternate leaves; stipules connate in pairs or free, naked or scale-covered buds;
erect or lax and axillary or terminal inflorescences; variation in pollen morphology; and cupules opposite/
whorled or alternate.
The monotypic Notholithocarpus was segregated from Lithocarpus and distinguished on the basis of
pollen morphology and multiradiate leaf trichomes (Manos et al. 2008). Indeed, as Manos et al. (2008)
commented, ‘we consider the pollen and multiradiate leaf trichomes and its phylogenetic placement to be
strong evidence to recognise L. densiflorus as a separate genus’.
The characters used by Nixon & Crepet (1989) and Manos et al. (2008) for the recognition of
Colombobalanus, Formanodendron and Notholithocarpus are directly comparable with the range of
characters that have been used to distinguish the four subgeneric groups in Nothofagus (Hill & Read 1991,
Manos 1997, Rozefelds 1998, Rozefelds & Drinnan 1998, 2002, Jordan & Hill 1999). Characters used to
define the subgenera in Nothofagus include those of leaf trichomes, leaf vernation, stomata, inflorescences,
flowers, pollen, and cupules.

Discussion
Our new phylogenetic analyses of morphological data support the monophyly of the four subgenera recognised
by Hill & Read (1991). This is consistent with the results of previous phylogenetic studies of morphological
and DNA sequence data (e.g. Hill & Jordan 1993, Martin & Dowd 1993, Manos 1997, Jordan & Hill 1999,
Cook & Crisp 2005, Sauquet et al. 2012). In addition to the four subgenera, four further clades meet the criteria
we have adopted for delimiting clades for taxonomic recognition in Nothofagaceae (category 1, see
introduction). That is, they received 95% or greater bootstrap support in the analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012)
and are diagnosable by morphological synapomorphies. These additional clades are: firstly, a clade including
the Nothofagus subgenera Fuscospora, Brassospora and Nothofagus; secondly, a clade comprising Nothofagus
subgenera Brassospora and Nothofagus; thirdly, an evergreen clade within subgenus Lophozonia (N.
cunninghamii, N. menziesii and N. moorei); and fourthly, the New Caledonian species of Nothofagus subgenus
Brassospora. However, the second of these additional clades does not appear in the shortest trees from
parsimony analysis of morphological characters alone (Fig. 1). Our morphological phylogeny has Nothofagus
subgenus Fuscospora as sister to Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora. However, the morphological phylogenies
of Manos (1997) and Jordan & Hill (1999) have Nothofagus subgenus Nothofagus as sister to Nothofagus
subgenus Brassospora; but we note that the species assigned to Nothofagus subgenus Fuscospora do not form
a clade in the strict consensus tree for morphological data in the study of Manos (1997). In our morphological
analysis an increase in tree length from 84 steps to 85 is required to make Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora
sister to Nothofagus subgenus Nothofagus. In our bootstrap analysis of the morphological data, the monophyly
of all the subgenera, and the sister group relationship between Nothofagus subgenus Lophozonia and the other
three subgenera, together are supported by moderate to high bootstrap values (between 81% and 100%), but
there is no support for relationships among the Nothofagus subgenera Brassospora, Fuscospora and
Nothofagus. The third additional clade, containing the evergreen Lophozonia species, is unambiguously
supported by our morphological analysis and robustly supported in the analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012), but its
sister group relationships to the deciduous genera were not robustly resolved in either analysis. Likewise, the

fourth clade (New Caledonian species of Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora) is unambiguously supported but
its sister group relationships to New Guinean taxa were not robustly resolved in either analysis.
Since 1991 support has also accumulated for the recognition of Nothofagaceae (Kuprianova 1962) as a
family distinct from Fagaceae. A close affinity of these two families within the order Fagales has been
strongly rejected by phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences. As a result the family Nothofagaceae and the
genus Nothofagus currently name the same clade and the rank of subgenus is introduced to name its
subclades—thereby using three taxonomic ranks (family, genus, and subgenus). The use of the secondary rank
of subgenus is not necessary and does not conform to our preference (category 2, criterion 1, see Introduction)
that primary ranks should be first used in a classification and secondary ranks only introduced if required. Our
preference is to raise the four Nothofagus subgenera of Hill & Read (1991) to generic rank. This maintains the
phylogenetic information encapsulated in the current taxonomy, but minimises the redundancy inherent in
names at two ranks referring to identical clades. Moreover, because generic names form part of the binomial
names of species, the groups they refer to are far more apparent to non-taxonomists than are subgenera. The
elevation of Hill and Read’s groups to genus rank will have the effect of promoting this important advance in
the understanding of relationships among species of Nothofagaceae outside taxonomic circles (category2,
criterion 2).
The recognition of four genera in Nothofagaceae would greatly increase the consistency of application of
genus rank across the Fagales in line with our view that genera should reflect evolutionarily-equivalent groups
(category 2, criterion 3, see Introduction). Specifically: 1—variation in genetic diversity of rbcL within and
among genera of other families of the Fagales is comparable with that found within and among the four clades
of Nothofagaceae. 2—morphological characters of recently described genera of the Fagaceae are comparable
with the characters that diagnose the four clades of the Nothofagaceae. 3—the four clades of the
Nothofagaceae have deep divergences older than or comparable with genera in other families of the Fagales
(Sauquet et al. 2012).
Alternative generic taxonomies for the Nothofagaceae could also recognise two or three genera. Two
genera could be the Lophozonia clade and another genus comprised of the remaining three Nothofagus
subgenera. Three genera could be the Lophozonia clade, the Fuscospora clade, and the Nothofagus and
Brassospora clades together. Either of these options would provide genera that are phylogenetically
equivalent to each other, but in each case the larger grouping would be morphologically heterogeneous and
still more diverse than genera in other families of Fagales. The three-genus option would recognise a genus
composed of the current Nothofagus subgenera Brassospora and Nothofagus. Although this clade is supported
by 95% or greater bootstrap value in the analysis of Sauquet et al. (2012), and is morphologically diagnosable,
therefore meeting our category 1 criterion—this clade is not supported by phylogenetic analysis of
morphological characters alone. This reflects the morphological heterogeneity of a clade combining the
current Nothofagus subgenera Brassospora and Nothofagus; this would be even more the case if Nothofagus
subgenus Fuscospora were also included with these latter two subgenera in a two-genus system.
Our final criterion for ranking clades—that of stability (category 2, criterion 5)—would clearly be best
achieved by maintaining the status quo; that is, one genus Nothofagus with four subgenera as recognised by
Hill & Read (1991). The two-, three-, and four-genus options would require successively more name changes.
However, we note that the genus Trisyngyne Baillon (1874: 136), originally placed by Baillon in
Euphorbiaceae, has been previously segregated from Nothofagus by Baumann-Bodenheim (1953, 1992) to
accommodate the members of Nothofagus subgenus Brassospora, although the majority of species require
new combinations in Trisyngyne. Steenis (1954, 1955, 1971, 1972, 1986) rejected this move, based on his
view that Nothofagus was certainly allied with Fagaceae—a position no longer tenable. The name Lophozonia
Turczaninow (1858: 396) is available at genus rank, although new combinations are required for all species.
In balance, we consider it appropriate in this case to sacrifice nomenclatural stability in the short term, given
that contemporary knowledge, as discussed above, means that the other category 1 and 2 criteria are best met
by four genera. Accordingly, in the Taxonomy section that follows we propose a new classification
recognising four genera in the Nothofagaceae.

HEENAN & SMISSEN

Additional evidence for the recognition of four genera in Nothofagaceae comes from three other sources.
Firstly, naturally occurring wild and cultivated Nothofagus hybrids have been recorded only between species
that belong to the same subgenus. These hybrids occur between species assigned to subgenus Fuscospora
[e.g., N. ×eugenananus Gillanders (2008: 56), N. ×apiculata (Colenso 1885: 335) Krasser (1896: 163), and N.
×blairii (Kirk 1885: 297, t. 16) Cockayne (1911: 172)], subgenus Lophozonia [e.g., N. ×dodecaphleps Grant
& Clement (2004: 448) and N. ×leonii Espinosa (1928: 187)], and subgenus Nothofagus (Cockayne &
Atkinson 1926, Wigston 1979, Donoso et al. 1990, Grant & Clement 2004, Stecconi et al. 2004, Gillanders
2008). This suggests a strong degree of intrinsic reproductive isolation among the different subgenera. This is
an important observation since species from the subgenera Fuscospora, Lophozonia and Nothofagus often
have sympatric distributions, and therefore have the opportunity to hybridise but apparently don’t. Subgenus
Brassospora has an isolated distribution in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and New Caledonia, and so has no
opportunity to hybridise with species from other subgenera.
Secondly, flavonoids provide diagnostic characters in Nothofagus subgenera Fuscospora, Lophozonia and
Nothofagus (Russell et al. 2000, Wollenweber et al. 2003). In subgenus Fuscospora most species are
characterized by the presence of pinosylvin, galangin flavonols and methyl ethers; in subgenus Lophozonia
there are abundant kaempferol-type flavonols and apigenin flavones, but galangin and pinosylvin are absent;
and in subgenus Nothofagus (N. antarctica only) galangin is present and pinosylvin is absent.
Thirdly, felt scales of the genera Madarococcus Hoy, Chilecoccus Miller & González, Chilechiton Hodgson
& Miller, and Intecticoccus Kondo (Eriococcidae) are almost exclusively Nothofagus feeding (Hardy et al.
2008), with different lineages corresponding to Nothofagus subgenera. Only one species, Madarococcus
podocarpi (Miller & Gimpel) Hoy has been collected from a host other than Nothofagus, being collected once
from the New Zealand Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (Richard 1832: 358) Laubenfels (1969: 337) (Hardy et al.
2008). There are three clades of South American Eriococcidae that occur on Nothofagus. One clade of
Chilechiton and Intecticoccus and another of Chilecoccus are endemic to South America and occur only on
Nothofagus subgenus Nothofagus. The third South American clade comprises species of Madarococcus that
occur on subgenera Nothofagus and Lophozonia. The New Zealand and Australian species of Madarococcus
form a clade that predominantly occurs on subgenus Lophozonia, but also subgenus Fuscospora.
Furthermore, a recent New Zealand study has shown greater similarity of the endophytic fungal
communities between species of subgenus Fuscospora (N. fusca and N. solandri) than between them and N.
menziesii (subgenus Lophozonia) (Johnston et al. 2012). While this study is restricted to New Zealand
species, further analyses of endophytic fungi on Nothofagaceae in other geographic regions are warranted.

Taxonomy
In the classification proposed here, we provide a family description for Nothofagaceae, descriptions for each
of its four genera, and where needed new combinations at species rank in Fuscospora, Lophozonia and
Trisyngyne. In addition to the application of subgeneric rank in Nothofagus several authors have proposed
additional taxonomic ranks utilising section, subsection and/or series (e.g. Steenis 1952a, 1953a, Philipson &
Philipson 1988, Hill & Read 1991). Here we do not recognise any taxa at infrageneric ranks, instead treating
the infrageneric taxa of other authors as synonyms or invalid names. We present available information on
holotype and lectotype specimens, and have undertaken lectotypifications when necessary. A full synonymy
of homotypic names is presented for the accepted species. We do not present a synonymy of heterotypic
names, and regional floras and other taxonomic treatments should be consulted for this.
There are well-preserved and identified fossil species of Nothofagaceae that have confidently been
identified with a Nothofagus subgenus, and these too should be transferred to the appropriate genus. However,
a considerable number of the fossil species of Nothofagaceae cannot be confidently placed in the genera
accepted in this treatment. Therefore, we envisage further nomenclatural papers that deal with the generic
placement of fossil names.

hybrid, but this was not validly published and was preceeded by the combination Fagus fusca var. dubia (Kirk

In proposing the conservation of Nothofagus, Steenis (1953b) did not nominate a type, but the proposal
was nonetheless recommended by the Committee for Spermatophyta with the provision that this deficiency
was remedied (Rickett 1958). When the conservation of the name was published, N. antarctica was given as
the type (Lanjouw et al. 1961, Appendix 3). This was an unfortunate choice as Blume (1851) did not include
N. antarctica among the species he placed in Nothofagus. Nothofagus subgenus Molischia and Nothofagus

Baumann-Bodenheim (1992) did not explicitly indicate a type for this taxon but included only T.
baumanniae which is acceptable as an indication of the type (McNeill et al. 2012, ICN Art. 40.3).
Trees up to 40 m high, or sometime shrubs. Leaves distichous or spiralled, conduplicate, evergreen, entire or

membranous or woody, glabrous, entire; fruits 1 or 3 dimerous.
Twenty-five species from Papua New Guinea, Indonesian Papua and New Caledonia.
Notes:—Baumann-Bodenheim (1992) proposed the transfer of a number of names in Nothofagus to
Trisyngyne. However, he did not provide a full and direct reference to the basionym and place of publication
and therefore his combinations are not validly published (McNeill et al. 2012, ICN Art. 41.5). It is therefore
necessary to make new combinations in Trisyngyne for names published in Nothofagus, and this action is
taken below.
