Abstract
Chrysosphaerella rotundata sp. nov. is described from a small lake in Finland. Ultrastructural morphology of C.
rotundata scales is similar, even identical, to the morphology of C. brevispina scales. However, C. rotundata possesses
three types of scales: scales characterized by a circular or almost circular outline were found in addition to the larger and
smaller oval scales. Significant genetic differences were recognized in ITS rDNA sequences between C. rotundata and
C. brevispina. Results of the molecular analyses and the observed morphological variation of scales have been discussed,
clearly showing the existence of a hidden diversity within the genus Chrysosphaerella.

Introduction
The genus Chrysosphaerella Lauterborn (1896: 16) represents free-living, autotrophic organisms covered
with siliceous scales and spines and bearing two flagella of unequal length. Cells may be solitary or grouped
in more or less spherical colonies. Two colonial taxa, C. longispina Lauterborn (1896: 16) and C. brevispina
Korshikov (1942: 31) emend. Harris & Bradley (1958: 75) are commonly found in freshwater habitats
(Kristiansen & Preisig 2001). Taxonomy of the genus Chrysosphaerella is based on ultrastrucutre of siliceous
scales and spines, and the images of C. longispina and C. brevispina include both transmission and scanning
electron micrographs (e.g. Nicholls 1980, Cronberg & Kristiansen 1980, Siver 1993). The phylogenetic
position of the genus Chrysosphaerella was reported by Andersen (2007) based on uncultured and
unidentified isolates. Subsequently, SSU rDNA and rbcL sequences of cultured C. brevispina and C.
longispina corroborated the phylogenetic position of Chrysosphaerella, which is firmly placed into the clade
comprising naked chrysophyte genera Chrysamoeba Klebs (1893: 407), Chromulina Cienkowski (1870: 435),
and Oikomonas Kent (1880: 230, 250) (Škaloud et al. 2013).
The detailed ecological study of C. brevispina and C. longispina has been published by Siver (1993), who
investigated their distribution along seasonal, temperature, pH, specific conductance, and total phosphorus
gradients. Chrysosphaerella brevispina and C. longispina have been proposed to be distributed primarily in
the winter and the summer/autumn months, respectively. Both taxa were found to be primarily distributed at
pH 5 to 7, and in waters having low specific conductance. However, C. brevispina has been proposed to
tolerate higher trophic and conductance conditions, which could explain its more common occurrence (Siver
1993).
Colonial Chrysosphaerella species are widely distributed worldwide (Siver 1993). Both species have been
reported from Finland as well (e.g. Hällfors & Hällfors 1988, Ikävalko 1994). During our investigation of
Finnish chrysophyte flora in the spring of 2012, we reported Chrysosphaerella taxa in several investigated
localities. Besides C. brevispina colonies bearing morphologically typical silica scales, some isolated colonies
were partially covered by distinct, rounded scales. Therefore, we aimed to further investigate the morphology
and phylogenetic position of this organism.

Material and methods
The material was collected on 1 May 2012 from a small, unnamed lake near the Alalampi lake in Central
Finland (62° 15’ 1.07” N, 26° 34’ 48.00” E, water temperature: 5.6 °C, pH: 7, conductivity: 40 μS cm-1), using
a plankton net with a mesh size of 20 μm. The Chrysosphaerella colonies were isolated by pipetting, and were
subsequently cultured at 15 °C in Erlenmeyer flasks filled with DY IV medium (Andersen et al. 1997). In
addition, we investigated the culture of C. brevispina S 74.D5 isolated from Dráchovské pools in the Czech
Republic (Škaloud et al. 2013). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations, the samples were
dried onto Formvar-coated copper grids and gently rinsed with distilled water. The TEM grids were examined
with a JEOL 1011 transmission electron microscope.
For DNA isolation, ca. 2000 cells were centrifuged in PCR tubes (6000 rpm for 3 minutes), and 50 mL of
InstaGene matrix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) was added to the pellet. The solution was vortexed for 10 s, incubated
at 56 °C for 30 min, and heated at 99 °C for 8 min. After vortexing a second time, the tubes were centrifuged at
12000 rpm for 2 min, and the supernatant was directly used as a PCR template. Two molecular markers were
ampliﬁed by PCR: nuclear SSU rDNA and chloroplast rbcL. The amplification of SSU rDNA was performed
as described by Škaloud et al. (2013), using the primers 18S-F and 18S-R (Katana et al. 2001). The
amplification of the rbcL marker was performed according to Jo et al. (2011), using the newly designed primers
rbcL-Chrys-F1 (5’-TTG GAC AGA TTT ATT AAC-3’), rbcL-Chrys-F2 (5’-TTA TTA ACW GCT TGT GAT3’) and rbcL-Chrys-R (5’-TCC ATR TCR AAG AAA ATW CC-3’). The amplification of ITS rDNA was
performed as described by Kynčlová et al. (2010). The PCR products were purified and sequenced at Macrogen
in Seoul, Korea. The newly obtained sequences of the ITS rDNA, SSU rDNA and rbcL regions of C. rotundata
and C. brevispina were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers HG315742 - HG315746.
A multiple alignment of the newly determined SSU rRNA and rbcL gene sequences and other sequences
selected from the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases was built using MAFFT, version 6, applying the Q-INS-i
strategy (Katoh et al. 2002). The sequences were selected to encompass all known Chrysophyte lineages, with
the exception of Paraphysomonadales, for which the rbcL sequences are unavailable. The final matrix
contained 52 taxa (51 SSU rDNA and 48 rbcL sequences, respectively). Nannochloropsis limnetica
(Eustigmatophyceae) and Synchroma grande (Picophagea/Synchromophyceae) were selected as ougroup.
Poorly aligned regions of the SSU rDNA partition, as well as the saturated positions of the rbcL partition,
were removed as described in Škaloud et al. (2013). The final concatenated alignment consisted of 2591 bp
comprising 1687 bp of SSU rDNA and 904 bp of rbcL. Suitable substitution models for the entire SSU rDNA
dataset and individual rbcL codon positions were selected using MEGA 5 (Tamura et al. 2011). The
GTR+G+I model was estimated as the most appropriate for all partitions.
The phylogenetic trees were inferred with Bayesian Inference (BI) by using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist &
Huelsenbeck 2003), maximum likelihood (ML) analysis using GARLI v. 2.0 (Zwickl 2006), and weighted
maximum parsimony (wMP) analysis using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002), respectively. BI analysis was
carried out on a partitioned dataset to differentiate among SSU rDNA gene and individual rbcL codon
positions. All parameters were unlinked among partitions. Two parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
runs were carried out for 5 million generations each with one cold and three heated chains. Trees and
parameters were sampled for every 100 generations. Parameter stability and run convergence were inspected
using Tracer v1.4.1 (Rambaut & Drummond 2003). The first 10% of samples were discarded as burnin, using
the “sumt” command. ML analysis was carried out on a partitioned dataset, with the GTR+G+I model applied
to each partition, using default settings, five search replicates, and the automatic termination set at 100000
generations. The wMP analysis was performed using heuristic searches with 1000 random sequence addition
replicates, TBR swapping, and random addition of sequences (the number was limited to 10000 for each
replicate). The weight to the characters was assigned using the rescaled consistency index on a scale of 0–
1000. New weights were based on the mean of the ﬁt values for each character over all of the trees in memory.
ML and MP bootstrap support values were obtained from 100 and 1000 bootstrap replicates, respectively.
Only one search replicate was applied for the ML bootstrapping.

Taxonomy
Chrysosphaerella rotundata Škaloudová & Škaloud, sp. nov. (Figs. 1–6)
Colonies spherical, consisting of cells bearing two flagella. Cells covered by numerous scales and spines. Three size
classes of scales occur: large circular scales (3.0–3.5 × 2.2–3.1 μm), large oval scales (2.0–3.1 × 1.3–2.4 μm), and
smaller oval scales (1.5–1.7 × 1.2 μm). Scales patterned with a series of short ridges forming a scalloped shaped
pattern. Spines with a shaft joining the two plates of the bobbin-like structure. The length of the spines varies from 4
μm to 10 μm. Cysts unknown.
Type:—FINLAND. Keski-Suomi, 62° 15’ 1.07” N, 26° 34’ 48.00” E, a small, oligotrophic unnamed lake, water
temperature 5.6 °C, pH 7, conductivity 40 μS cm-1, coll. Škaloudová & Škaloud, 1 May 2012 (holotype: Strain
S89.C4, frozen material deposited at the Culture Collection of Algae of the Charles University in Prague,
Department of Botany, Benátská 2, 12801 Prague 2, Czech Republic). Fig. 2 is an illustration of the holotype.

Cells were grouped into spherical colonies. Individual cells were spherical to pyriform, about 12–13 μm long
and 11 μm wide, bearing two flagella. Cells were covered by numerous scales and spines. Three size classes
of scales might be discerned; however, a continuous transition in size of scales existed. The majority of the
scales were larger and oval in outline (Figs. 1, 3). The second type of the scales, larger and circular in outline,
were produced less frequently (Fig. 2). However, presence of the large, circular-shaped scales was a main
distinguishing character of Chrysosphaerella rotundata. Both large circular and oval scales were patterned
with a series of short ridges forming a scalloped shaped pattern. The pattern of smaller oval scales (Fig. 3) was
the same as that of larger scales, but often less distinct. The spines had a thick shaft joining the two plates of
the bobbin-like structure (Figs. 4–5); however, a variation in the thickness of the shaft was observed and
spines with a thinner shaft were found as well (Fig. 6).
Etymology:—The specific epithet ‘rotundata’ refers to the rounded shape of scales.
Phylogenetic analyses, ITS2 secondary structures:—Bayesian inference, Maximum Likelihood, and
Maximum Parsimony analyses inferred from the concatenated SSU rDNA and rbcL sequences resulted in
highly similar phylogenetic trees, recognizing the six main lineages within Chrysophyceae (Fig. 7). According
to their members, the lineages could be recognized as traditionally defined orders: Chromulinales,
Chrysosaccales, Hibberdiales, Hydrurales, Ochromonadales, and Synurales. With the exception of the
Ochromonadales, all lineages were also significantly supported by ML and wMP analyses. Both analyses
resolved the Ochromonadales as monophyletic, but without any statistical support. The genus
Chrysosphaerella formed a firmly supported monophyletic lineage within the Chromulinales (Fig. 7). It was
divided into two supported subclades. Chrysosphaerella rotundata was inferred as closely related to
morphologically similar C. brevispina, with which it formed the first inferred subclade. The species differed by
eight and eleven nucleotide substitution changes in the SSU rDNA and rbcL sequences, respectively. The
second subclade consisted of C. longispina and two environmental Chrysosphaerella isolates. Since the isolates
were molecularly characterized by only the SSU rDNA (summer isolate) or rbcL (winter isolate) sequence, we
could not exclude that they in fact belong to the same genotype. The environmental isolates differed by two
nucleotide substitution changes in the SSU rDNA and rbcL sequences from the C. longispina sequences.
To further evaluate the degree of genetic differentiation of the closely related C. rotundata and C.
brevispina, we additionally sequenced the ITS1-5.8S rDNA-ITS2 region. The ITS1 region was hardly
alignable, and the sequences differed significantly in their length (342 bp in C. rotundata vs. 294 bp in C.
brevispina). Within the aligned regions, the divergence between the ITS1 rDNA sequences was approximately
15.5%. The length of the ITS2 region was similar in both species (293 bp in C. rotundata vs. 287 bp in C.
brevispina), and the overall divergence between the ITS2 rDNA sequences was approximately 12.5%. In
addition, we mapped the differences in the ITS2 sequence on a predicted ITS2 secondary structure (Fig. 8).
Most of the differences were located in terminal and internal hairpin loops. Four compensatory base changes
(CBCs) were found in the stem regions of helices I and II.

Discussion
Chrysosphaerella brevispina is characterized by two types of scales, differing by their size. Siver (1993) has
measured both types of scales found in several North American localities: the dimension of the larger oval
scales was 2.9–4.0 × 1.4–2.5 μm, and the mean size of the smaller oval scales was 1.7 × 0.8 μm. This
observed range of scale sizes of both the large and the small types is in agreement with the C. brevispina
scales found in Europe (own unpublished data). In Chrysosphaerella rotundata, both large and small scale
types are also produced. Morphologically, they are identical to C. brevispina by their oval shape, but they tend
to be slightly shorter and wider. Besides the larger and smaller oval scales, C. rotundata possesses the third,
newly recognized type of scales, characterized by a circular or almost circular outline. Interestingly, large,
more or less circular Chrysosphaerella scales have been recorded by Nicholls (1984), who considered them as
belonging to C. brevispina. However, only oval scales were mentioned and illustrated in Korshikov’s original
description of C. brevispina (Korshikov 1942), based on light microscopic investigations. Subsequently,
Harris & Bradley (1958) have emendated Korshikov’s description by characterizing the detailed
ultrastructural morphology of the C. brevispina scales and spines observed by electron microscope. Congruent
with the original description, they have recorded the oval shaped scales only.

The above-mentioned morphological differences warrant the recognition of C. brevispina and C.
rotundata as two distinct species. The existence of these two species is further supported by significant
genetic differences found in their ITS rDNA sequences. Within the past two decades, the ITS rDNA region
has become the single most frequently utilized DNA marker to assess species diversity in various groups of
microalgae, including chrysophyte algae (Wee et al. 2001, Kynčlová et al. 2010, Boo et al. 2010, Škaloud et
al. 2012). The observed sequence divergence in both the ITS1 rDNA (15.5%) and the ITS2 rDNA (12.5%)
region is much higher or comparable to the differences observed among the recently described cryptic species
within the S. petersenii complex (Škaloud et al. 2012), where it varies from 2 to 13% in the ITS1 region and 5
to 12% in the ITS2 region, respectively). In addition, a comparison of ITS2 secondary structures of C.
brevispina and C. rotundata revealed the presence of four compensatory base changes (CBCs) in the stem
regions of helices I and II. According to the CBC species concept, the presence of even a single CBC in
helices II and III should correspond to incompatibility to sexually cross, and thus determines the limit between
biological species (Coleman 2000). However, since the application of the CBC species concept in species
delimitation is still speculative (Caisová et al. 2011), we rather consider the presence of three CBCs as an
attribute of elapsed evolutionary time, indicating that sufficient time has passed to produce a speciation event
(Müller et al. 2007).
Finally, our results provide the first clear evidence of the existence of hidden diversity within the genus
Chrysosphaerella. Observations of morphologically exceptional Chrysosphaerella scales were occasionally
reported in the past. Apart from the large, circular scales (Nicholls 1984), morphologically distinct triangular
shaped scales were reported by Siver (1993) in Connecticut, U.S.A. and by Wujek et al. (1981) in Minnesota,
U.S.A. It is highly probable that all these scales in fact belong to a yet undescribed, hidden species. Recently
published studies provide clear data that hidden species could significantly differ in their ecological niche
(e.g., Amato et al. 2007, Pfandl et al. 2009). Therefore, characterization of these species is extremely
important as it may provide the key to correctly interpret the distribution, abundance, and biology of
planktonic organisms.
