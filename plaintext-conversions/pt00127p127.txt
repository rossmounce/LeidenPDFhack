Abstract
The diatom species Synedra berolinensis has been placed in the genus Synedra, Fragilaria, Staurosira, Staurosirella as
well as its own monotypic genus, Belanostrum. It is recently returned to Staurosirella. This prompts a pertinent question:
Why is Synedra berolinensis so hard to classify? One answer may be the inappropriateness of the evidence (data).
Another may be the approach to classifying the organism, especially the use of monotypic taxa for problematic groups. I
will address both aspects, concentrating more on the latter: How do we classify?
Key words: Synedra berolinensis, evidence (data), classification, monotypic taxa

Introduction
In the relatively short space of just over 20 years (1989–2003), the freshwater planktonic diatom species
named Synedra berolinensis Lemmerm. (1900a: 31) has been shifted from Synedra Ehrenb. to Fragilaria
Lyngb. (Lange-Bertalot 1989; Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 1991; Lange-Bertalot 1993), Staurosira Ehrenb.
(Krammer & Lange-Bertalot 2000), Staurosirella D.M. Williams & Round (Bukhityarova 1995) and its own
genus, Belanostrum Round & Maidiana (Round & Madiana 2001), before returning to Staurosirella (Morales
2003) (summarised in Table 1).

Synedra berolinensis is by no means the only species related to the many old fragilarioid taxa that has
shifted generic position frequently: Fragilaria shiloi J.J. Lee, Reimer & McEnery (1980: 43), for example,
has been in four genera since its discovery in 1980, including its own genus (Table 2a), and Opephora martyi
Hérib. (1902: 43) has been in three genera including its own, with a fourth suggested (Table 2b).
Given the frequently shifting position of Synedra berolinensis, it seems appropriate to ask the following
question: Why does it seem so hard to classify? Relevant to that question is the role of monotypic taxa, a
subject I touched upon previously (Williams 2009).

Synedra berolinensis Lemmerm.
Taxonomic history: the first 50 years
In a series of papers on planktonic algae (“Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Planktonalgen”), Ernst Lemmermann
(1867–1915, for biographical data on Lemmermann see Bitter 1919) described a number of new taxa from
European Lakes, some assigned to the genus Synedra (Lemmermann 1900a; 1900b; 1904; 1906). Synedra
berolinensis was one of these, first presented with just a short description and no illustrations (Lemmermann
1900a). Lemmermann’s description is succinct enough to quote in full:
“Zellen 25–34µ lang, zu 4–24µ zu büschelförmigen, strahligen, freischwimmenden Colonien
vereinigt. Valvarseite gerade, in der Mitte etwas bauchig erweitert, an den Enden 1,3µ, in der
Mitte 2, 5µ breit. Querstreifen kurz, die Mitte nicht erreichend.”
But Lemmermann did more than simply describe new taxa. He created an additional hierarchical level in
the classification of Synedra by placing some species—Synedra ulna (Nitzsch 1817: 99) Ehrenb. (1832: 87), S.
delicatissima W. Sm. (1853: 72) and S. acus Kütz. (1844: 68)—in the Section (‘Sectio’ I.) Eusynedra, and his
new taxa—S. actinastroides Lemmerm. (1900a: 30), and their varieties, and S. berolinensis—in a new section
(‘Sectio’ II.), Belonastrum1. Thus, Lemmermann determined what might be called two different ‘kinds’ (subgroups) of Synedra, captured by his division into Sections (‘Sectio’). Of significance is not just the creation of
two sections but his reasons for doing so (the evidence). Lemmermann described his two sections thus:
“I. Sectio: Eunsynedra Schütt: Zellen einzeln, freischwimmend oder testsitzend” [Cells
individually, free-swimming or attached]…
“II. Section: Belonastrum nob.: Zellen zur freischwimmenden, büschelförmigen, strahligen
Colonien vereinigt” [Cells free-swimming, in star-shaped colonies]. (Lemmermann 1900a: 31,
my translation).

While Mills (1933: 265–266) lists several species in this section, it is clear that he understands Lemmermann’s taxon
as a section.

Lemmermann’s sections were thus separated on the basis of the character ‘colony formation’. That some
species were found in the plankton (pelagic), an unusual (at that time) habitat for species in the genus
Synedra, was the reason Lemmermann created his classification (summarised in Figure 1a).

(‘sectio’) Belanastrum. (b) Branching diagram representing the classification of Synedra in Gemeinhardt (1926).

In 1926 Konrad Gemeinhardt undertook a revision of Synedra (Gemeinhardt 1926). He placed Synedra
berolinensis, S. actinastroides and S. limnetica Lemmerm. (1900b: 275) (all members of Lemmermann’s
Section Belonastrum) in his “Pseudoraphe breit” (pseudoraphe broad) sub-group, alongside S. affinis Kütz.
(1844: 68), S. affinis f. typica Hust. (in A. Schmidt et al. 1914: pl. 304, figs 6–12), S. affinis var. obtusa Hust.
(in A. Schmidt et al. 1914: pl. 304, figs 13–16) and S. affinis var. fasciculata (C. Agardh 1812: 35) Grun. in
Van Heurck (1885: 153). In the “Pseudoraphe schmal” (pseudoraphe narrow) sub-group, the other half of the
pair within the larger group (“Schalen ohre falschen Mittelknoten (Pseudonodulus)”—valves with ‘false’
central area, pseudonodulus)—Gemeinhardt placed S. ulna alongside species usually associated with the more
‘typical’ members of Eusynedra (Synedra biceps Kütz. (1844: 66), S. goulardii Bréb. (ex Cleve & Grun. 1880:
107), etc., species now understood as part of Ulnaria Kütz., see Williams 2011). Gemeinhardt added more
characters (properties of the ‘pseudoraphe’ and central area) and more (un-named) divisions and subdivisions, presenting the whole as a classification with species names appended to each sub-division
(Gemeinhardt 1926: 37, see Figure 1b)2.
Hustedt subsequently presented two different classifications for the sub-groups of Synedra. In 1930, he
offered a rather complex series of sub-divisions in the form of a key (Hustedt 1930: 149–151). One of
Hustedt’s main sub-divisions was based on ‘Apikalasche gerade…’ (apical axis straight) which in turn was
sub-divided into ‘Zellen büschelig-mehrstrahlige, freischwimmende Kolonien bildend’ and ‘Zellen nicht
derartige Kolonien bilden’ (similar to Lemmermann’s divisions). The former sub-group contained Synedra
berolinensis, S. actinastroides and S. acus, while the latter contained all other freshwater species of Synedra
(Figure 2a).
Yet in 1932, Hustedt presented what might be referred to as a proper classification (as opposed to his 1930
key), in which he recognised three sub-genera, Eusynedra, Belanostrum and Ardissonia (Figure 2b). By
implication, none of Hustedt’s three groups is considered to be more closely related to any other (there is no
hierarchical structure to the classification beyond recognising three sub-genera). Interestingly enough, of the

Gemeinhardt also noted the potential of cytoplasmic characters for future classification data

sub-genus Belanostrum, Hustedt wrote that it “…stimmt sowohl im Bau der Zellwand als auch in der
Zellform völlig mit Eusy nedra überein, ein wesentlicher Unterschied besteht jedoch in der
Koloniebildung…under der damit zusammenhängenden pelagischen Lebensweise” (Hustedt 1932: 183;
“Belanostrum fully agrees with Eusynedra conforming in the structure of its valves as well as its cell.
However, there exists a substantial difference in colony formation which is associated with a pelagic mode of
life”, translation adapted from Jensen 1985: 170). Therefore, Hustedt explicitly agreed with Lemmermann’s
viewpoint, believing that the ‘mode of life’ is sufficient grounds for recognising a sub-group, in spite of the
fact that he sees ‘full’ agreement in valve structure between Eusynedra and Belonastrum. Nevertheless, he
goes on to stress that the sub-genera Belanostrum and Ardissonia “…von sehr ungleichem Wert sind”
(Hustedt 1932: 183, “are of very unequal merit [value]”, translation adapted from Jensen 1985: 170) without
explaining the nature of that inequality.
It might be argued, with some justification, that Lemmermann, Gemeinhardt and Hustedt were simply
trying to clarify how one might identify the various species thought to belong to Synedra rather than
attempting to create a ‘natural’ classification (one that expresses their relationships), and their use of sections
and sub-genera (as well as the many un-named subdivisions) were designed to facilitate ease of identification
—as in a continually modified and updated key.

Taxonomy and light microscope (LM) images—the data
It is worth considering for a moment just what data were available for diatomists to make their judgements.
Although described in 1900, no illustrations of Synedra berolinensis appeared until 1904, when Lemmermann
described and named a new variety of S. berolinensis—S. berolinensis var. gracilis Lemmerm. (1904: 310)—
and offered a further brief description accompanied with some simple line drawings of both Synedra
berolinensis (Lemmermann 1904: fig. 16, Fig. 3) and the new variety (Lemmermann 1904: fig. 17). Two years
later, along with the description of Synedra revaliensis Lemmerm.3, Lemmermann provided a key for all of

the eight planktonic taxa he had described in the past few years that were included in his ‘Sectio’ Belonastrum
(Lemmermann 1906; see below and the first eight entries in Table 3). But even after Lemmermann’s series of
papers it appears that very few illustrations of S. berolinensis were published. Hustedt (in Schmidt et al. 1914:
pl. 306, figs 17, 18), for example, illustrated two partial colonies from “Holstein” (some details of the valve
structure can be appreciated from his figure 18). Hustedt reproduced these illustrations in three European
floras (Hustedt 1930: 164, fig. 200; Hustedt 1932: 184, fig. 686; Hustedt 1942: 457, fig. 533, also reproduced
by Cleve-Euler 1953: fig. 377a–c and Zabelina et al. 1951: 141, fig. 1a; the original images were derived from
Hustedt’s contribution to Schmidt Atlas for 1914: Hustedt in A. Schmidt et al. 1914). Subsequently, Krieger
(1927: figs 28a–h, j, k) presented some new illustrations, which Cleve-Euler reproduced in her flora (CleveEuler 1953: fig. 377d, e). In short, up until the mid-1950s even though Synedra berolinensis had been
recognised for nearly half a century, it appears to have been known from only a handful of drawings, many of
them being copied from one source to another as illustrations for commonly used floras.
Taxonomy and the scanning electron microscope (SEM)
One might argue that the history of Belanostrum above, and its interpretation, is now largely irrelevant, as
many of the species thought to be Synedra-like (and members of the group Belanostrum) by Lemmermann
have subsequently been placed elsewhere, such as in the very different genus Nitzschia Hassall, or else are
now synonyms of S. berolinensis itself (Table 3). Nevertheless, further data became available with the
introduction of scanning electron microscopy.

the final column, although revision might be necessary in some cases to establish the synonymy with greater certainty

According to Gaul et al. (1993), Cronberg (1982: Figs 164–5) provided the first SEM image of Synedra
berolinensis, although two images presented in Round (1979: figs 1, 2) predate that paper by 3 years (it should
be noted that Round did not name his taxon, writing in the plate legend “a species of the section Belonastrum,
but not in the Synedra complex”). These were followed a few years later with three images published by
Lange-Bertalot (1989). More recently, there have been two detailed studies, the first by Round & Maidana
(2001) the other by Morales (2003), both authors coming to different conclusions. In spite of the new
morphological data, Round & Maidana (2001) made their decision to place Synedra berolinensis in its own
genus based on, among other things, its ‘habitat’ (like Hustedt earlier), while Morales (2003), after reviewing
the morphological evidence, found it convincing enough to retain the species in Staurosirella (Round &
Maidana did not present girdle band data but refer to their number), following Bukhityarova (1995: 418).
With respect to classification, this kind of approach has continued in diatom systematics up to the present,
regardless of the source of data: the continual updating and modifying of generic descriptions, often discussed
in terms of ‘limits’, as if definitions of taxa were like the borders of a country, occasionally expanding,
occasionally contracting, depending on who was waging war (and who was ‘winning’) but retaining the same
name to give the illusion of stability (or conquest).
When in doubt, or when presented with a number of apparently ‘key’ features, the taxon is often placed in
a monotypic group. This process is akin to the construction of an artificial classification (keys) rather than
natural classification, as a monotypic group, in this sense, is simply the sum of a set of unusual characters.
Current knowledge of Synedra berolinensis
Estimates of our current knowledge concerning Synedra berolinensis are hard to make and somewhat
dependant on an understanding of what knowledge might mean. A rough guide can be gained from the
number of citations, given that an unknown percentage of those citations might be misidentifications.
One way to ascertain citations is to use an Internet search engine where the numbers of hits may indicate a
rough estimate of knowledge or applied knowledge attributed to this species. Using Google
(www.google.com), roughly 16 to 17,000 hits were recovered, with considerably fewer using Bing
(www.bing.com) (c. 50). With respect to searches for images, only two were found, relative to the 48
published drawings and light microscope images and 25 scanning electron microscope images (Table 4).
Thus, very little actually appears to be known about Synedra berolinensis although, given the 17,000 records,
it appears to be well known.

two images were found: that from College of Biological Sciences, University of Tsukuba and one other.

Classification
“Is it not extraordinary that young taxonomists are trained like performing monkeys, almost
wholly by imitation, and that in only the rarest cases are they given any instruction in taxonomic
theory?” (Cain 1959: 243)
Cain’s viewpoint should now be considered anachronistic, gone forever. We have since learnt that there are
two aspects to natural classification: groups (taxa) and evidence (characters). More precisely, evidence is
required to support proposals of groups (taxa). Re-phrased as a scientific problem, the task is to establish what
evidence there is for the groups we wish to recognise and what is the relationship of the evidence to the
group? What data imply particular relationships (groups) so that various organisms can be collected together
in species, genera, families, etc. and named? Formulated as such, the naming is no longer an art but guided by
scientific principles. First I consider the relationship of evidence to the names.
Investigation of characters usually leads to the conclusion that data apply to some species in varying
degrees. If Figure 3, for example, is the result of an analysis (either molecular or morphological data) a
conclusion might be that there is evidence to suggest a group E–L to the exclusion of A–D (Figure 3, node 1);
evidence to suggest a group E–H to the exclusion of A–D and I–L (Figure 3, node 2); evidence to suggest
there is a group E–F to the exclusion of A–D and G–L (Figure 3, node 3); and so on (Figure 3, nodes 4–6).
Support for nodes 1–6 can be any number of characters from 1 upwards—the number is not significant. It
should be obvious that only those groups supported by evidence deserve names, so in the diagram in Figure 3
there are 7 potential groups that could be named, those that correspond to nodes 0–6. The taxonomic level is
also not particularly important. For example, node 0 might be a named a Class, node 1 an Order, nodes 2 and
4 Families, and nodes 3 and 5 genera (node 6 remains unnamed): data, relationships and the classification
hierarchy are isomorphic—they all speak to the same thing (Table 5). The important thing—the ‘absolute
standard’ (Williams 2009) if you like—is to name only the nodes, christening the evidence, as it were (Table
5). There is no fixed amount of evidence, or type of group, that corresponds to a genus: it is assigned to a
particular taxonomic level, not discovered by some measure of similarity (Sato et al. 2008). That applies to all
taxonomic levels. Therefore evidence (data) requires not simply collecting and enumerating but interpretation
so that nodes may be discovered. The only significant method of character interpretation for natural
classifications is cladistics, a theory of systematics outlined many years ago for diatomists that recognises
synapomorphies (shared, derived characters) as support for nodes (groups, taxa) (see Kociolek et al. 1987 and
Williams & Kociolek 2010; Williams & Ebach 2007).

The Problem of Monotypic Taxa
Among the species in Figure 3, A–D may be understood as unusual as there is no evidence to suggest their
relationships to any other taxon beyond their inclusion in the entire group, as defined by node 0 (Figure 3). As
taxonomic (Linnaean) convention demands that all species have a generic name, a question may arise as to
what genus A–D belong? One might be tempted to put all four together and call them a genus, basal to all
other taxa. However, that would name a group for which there is no evidence—by evidence I mean characters
(synapomorphies) unique to A–D. One solution would be for species A–D to each have their own monotypic
generic name, which would indicate only their unknown relationships within the larger group. This may seem
an excessive use of generic names but it is the only way the four species (A–D) can be recognised as distinct
entities, separate from each other as well as the rest of the group, without implying relationships not supported
by data. The same logic applies to taxon G and H (Figure 3; an alternative could be to assign a generic name
to species E–H leaving node 3 unnamed). This appears to be the only logical use of monotypic taxa: indicators
of unknown relationships.

FIGURE 3. Hypothetical tree (classification) of 12 species with 7 nodes (0–6). See Table 5 and text. Node 1 suggests there is
evidence to support a group E–L to the exclusion of A–D; that there is evidence to support a group E–H to the exclusion of A–D and
I–L; that there is evidence to support a group E–F to the exclusion of A–D and G–L, etc., through all nodes 4–6. The assignment of
taxonomic level is not particularly important (see Table 5, for an example), only the monophyly of each: data, relationships and the
classification hierarchy are isomorphic.

This is not how the concept is applied generally, especially among ‘protist’ systematics (including
diatoms). It is usually adopted to indicate a certain level of (unknown) measurable distinction, such that there
are a number of characters (or percentage of difference) that ‘qualify’ a particular species for special
treatment. A recent ‘protist’ example is worth examining in detail. In a paper published in the journal Protist
describing some new taxa in the heterotrophic flagellate group Bicosoecida (an order of colourless, free-living
protozoans), three new monotypic genera were named (Kim et al. 2010). Detailed morphological
(ultrastructural) data was recorded but DNA sequence data was used as the primary source of evidence to
determine the relationships of the three new genera relative to all other Bicosoecids. The results of their
analysis were presented in a series of tree diagrams (Kim et al. 2010, figs 11–13). Of general interest is the

has 12 nodes (Fig. 4, nodes 0–11). Nine of the 13 species are placed in monotypic genera (Fig. 4; taxon names
are followed by a figure that indicates the number of included species). What is the justification? Kim et al.
write: “SSU rDNA gene sequence differences among these flagellates are over 8%...providing a rationale for
describing them as three separate genera” (Kim et al. 2010: 187); and “These genetic differences are greater
than those between some morphologically and ecologically distinct species of
Chrysophyceae+Synurophyceae” (Kim et al. 2010: 187, my italics). One might, then, ask why 8% gene
difference – why not 9%, or 10%, or 7%? Medlin (1997: 20) offers further guidance: “…values of less than
80% similarity are generally taken to indicate that separate species are involved…”. But, again, why 80%?
And “generally taken”? By whom?

FIGURE 4. Tree representing the results of Kim et al. (2010: fig. 11). In this tree, there are 13 species related to one another in
varying degrees; the tree is fully resolved with 12 nodes; 9 of the 13 species are monotypic genera (taxon names are followed by a
figure to indicate numbers of included species).

One might contrast that effort with a recent diatom study, one already commented upon (Williams 2009).
For the monotypic genus Pseudostriatella, Sato et al. suggested there were “many morphological and
ecological similarities between P. oceanica and S. [Striatella] unipunctata…”, which they regarded as
“sufficient to differentiate these taxa at the rank of genus” (Sato et al. 2008: 383). Sufficient remains
undefined. They continue: “…there is no absolute standard for the amount of sequence difference that
justifies generic status” (Sato et al. 2008: 386, italics mine). So, somehow, and somewhat oddly in this case,
sufficiency can be estimated from morphology, whereas no such estimate can be made for the molecular data.
In contrast, Kim et al. suggested that “Filos agilis and Nanos amicus were similar in morphology…”( Kim et
al. 2010: 181) and “similar in morphology to Siluania monomastiga” (Kim et al. 2010: 187), but “Although
Filos, Nanos, and Siluania share many morphological features, SSU rDNA gene sequence differences among
these flagellates are over 8%...” (Kim et al. 2010: 187). In this case, sharing of “many morphological
features” is trumped by the 8% sequence difference. None of these arguments possess any logic whatsoever –
they are merely arbitrary choices plucked, as it were, from thin air.
For Kim et al., as well as various diatomists, the abundance of monotypic genera is (positively) misleading
with respect to classification, obscuring rather than clarifying relationships. Monotypic genera (and higher
taxa) are reflections of ignorance (unknown relationships) rather than knowledge (Williams 2009).

Evidence for Classification of Synedra berolinensis
For evidence, I present an analysis of available molecular data relevant to the taxonomic position of Synedra
berolinensis. This should not be taken as an exhaustive study but one undertaken simply to demonstrate some
points about classification and evidence. In brief, 170 diatom SSU rRNA sequences were obtained from
GenBank and aligned using BioEdit (1997–2004) from ClustalW’s accessory applications (ClustalW was
implemented using BioEdit’s default options, Larkin et al. 2007). As in a previous analysis (Williams 2009), 7
species were used as outgroups: Arcocellulus mammifer Hasle, Stosch & Syvertsen (1983: 55), Cymatosira
belgica Grun. in Van Heurck (1881: pl. 45, fig. 38–41), Extubocellulus spinifer (Hargraves & Guillard 1974:
168) Hasle, Stosch & Syvertsen (1983: 70), Minutocellus polymorphus (Hargraves & Guillard 1974: 166)
Hasle, Stosch & Syvertsen (1983: 43), Minutocellus sp. CCMP1701?, Papiliocellulus elegans Hasle, Stosch
& Syvertsen (1983: 64) and Talaroneis posidoniae Kooistra & Stefano (in Kooistra et al. 2004: 60). The final
alignment yielded 2929 bases of which 2365 were uninformative, leaving 564 bases (19%) useful for
determining relationships (the ‘pack’ option in the computer program NONA, designed to remove
uninformative characters from any alignment, yielded a final matrix of 561 characters, discarding 2368, three
more than Winclada for reasons that were not apparent, Nixon 1999–2002). Parsimony analysis of the 561
characters (using NONA from within Winclada, Goloboff 1999) yielded 58 trees of length 3069, a
consistency index (ci) of 47 and a retention index (ri) of 84. The consensus tree of the 58 most parsimonious
trees has a length of 3123, ci 46 and ri of 83, 54 steps longer than each most parsimonious tree but with nearly
identical ci and ri values (alignments and Nexus files available).

Staurosira-like groups, e.g. Staurosira, Martyana, Staurosirella, Punctastriata and Pseudostaurosira. The total tree (Figures 5, 6a and

presentation, the section has been split into three parts: Fig. 5, nodes 0–5, Fig. 6a, nodes 6–10, and 6b, nodes
11–16. The tree in Fig. 5 connects to Fig. 6a via the branch that terminates with the Greek letter alpha (α); Fig.
6a joins to Fig. 6b via the branch that terminates with the Greek letter beta (β). I only briefly discuss these
topologies to highlight a few general conclusions. The most obvious point to make is that with respect to the
entire tree, generic names are scattered throughout the topology making its understanding less than intuitive.
Clearly either current names do not reflect molecular relationships or molecular data do not reflect taxon
relationships as represented by their names. Given that the morphological data remain unanalysed, it is, as yet,
impossible to learn if there is any real conflict between the morphological and molecular data.

FIGURE 6. Second part of one section of the consensus tree from the analysis undertaken herein, split into two: a and b. Figure 6a
joins to Figure 6b via the branch that terminates with the Greek letter beta (β). Figure 6a has nodes 6–10, Figure 6b has nodes 11–16.
Note position of Synedra berolinensis as basal to all species from node 9.

Figure 6 has two items of interest. First, node 3 groups all the specimens named Nanofrustulum Round,
Hallsteinsen & Paasche alongside specimens named Fragilaria pinnata Ehrenb. (1843: 127) (these group
together in Rampen et al. 2007: figure 2). This offers a prediction. Investigation of the specimens named
Fragilaria pinnata will show them to have the characters of Nanofrustulum—which, of course, depends on
knowing the characters of Nanofrustulum (Witkowski et al. 2010; also Sar & Sunesen 2003, Li et al. 2008 and
Morales 2001: 115). Second, node 4 groups seven species, of which 5 are named Pseudostaurosiropsis E.
Morales (2001: 116). This provides a second prediction. The specimens named Staurosira sp. I-141 and
Punctastriata sp. E-05 will be found to have the characters of Pseudostaurosiropsis—which also depends
upon knowing the characters of Pseudostaurosiropsis.
Figure 7b appears to be a jumble of taxon names and few generalities can be drawn from this assemblage
of species except to note that, somewhere, there is, obviously, a problem. That problem may be related to
sampling, method of analysis, identification of specimens, previous characterisation of species and so on, but
one must assume the problem is empirical: it can be investigated. From the perspective of the question
addressed in this paper, Fig. 6a includes Synedra berolinensis as sister to Staurosira cf. mutabilis plus all taxa

in Fig. 6b. So: How can we classify Synedra berolinensis from this result?
There are a number of options all based on identifying monophyletic groups, those circumscribed by
particular nodes (Williams 2009). On might be tempted to name all species from node 9 onwards as members
of one genus. That would leave three basal to that group: Synedra berolinensis, Staurosira sp. D-10 and
Staurosira sp. D-20. Assuming that the latter two names are provisional, a sensible option for the moment,
would be to simply ignore them, leaving Synedra berolinensis basal to node 9 and the possibility of naming it
as a monotypic group as its relationships beyond node 8 are unknown. Yet this seems to be unsatisfactory as
the scattering of names from node 6 onwards suggests that nothing is yet really known of these relationships
and, for pragmatic purposes, all the species should be in the same genus, including Synedra berolinensis. But
this too depends on knowing the characters of the included species.

Discussion
These molecular data do not unequivocally resolve the problem of the classification of Synedra berolinensis.
It is, of course, possible to classify the resulting tree but as can be seen above, that too is imprecise, even if
proper attention is given to monotypic groups (Williams 2009).
The imprecision of these results to one side, this highlights a major drawback to molecular data: there is,
as yet, no real evidence presented to support any of the nodes. In morphological systematics, when data are
analysed, evidence (synapomorphies) is presented to support each node and subsequent work might focus on
whether those characters are indeed synapomorphies or not: in short, the matter can be investigated. But with
molecular data, there is no real evidence to support any of the nodes, or at least the evidence is not specified.
With molecular studies any subsequent analyses are seen as superior simply (or usually) because there are
more data and more taxa and therefore somehow must be better (Mooi and Gill 2010 and Mooi et al. 2011,
present some general arguments critical to these matters). Thus, if node 9 was supported by some tangible data
(rather than a vague statistic) one might then thereby determine whether Synedra berolinensis does or does not
have the relevant characters.
Why is Synedra berolinensis so hard to classify? From the point of view of principles, it is not—just that
these data, so far, are insufficient to determine its relationships. One might think, for Synedra berolinensis at
least, it is time to return to morphology, data which, as noted above, have barely accumulated in any
meaningful way. Morphology, and its analysis (the identification of synapomorphies), seems just too
important to dismiss in spite of those who misunderstand its role (e.g. Mann et al. 2008: 66: “However,
sampling for molecular analysis is still too meagre and patchy to allow us to test fully the subjective,
morphology-based classification of British Sellaphora that we have given here and it will probably be several
years before enough isolates of all the demes are available”, italics mine). Morphology could only be
understood as ‘subjective’ as long as it remains unanalysed.
