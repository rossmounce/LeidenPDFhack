Abstract
The two species of Veratrum in Thailand, V. mengtzeanum and V. chiengdaoense, are supported as conspecific
with a detailed morphological study. Two distinct subspecies of V. mengzeanum s.l. are defined based on
morphology and distribution, and a new subspecies, Veratrum mengzeanum subsp. phuwae is described.
Conservation assessments are provided for both subspecies.

Introduction
Melanthiaceae comprise five tribes of mainly perennial herbs occurring in the temperate zones (occasionally
extending to Arctic zones) of the Northern Hemisphere (APG 2009; Tamura 1998; Zomlefer et al. 2001,
2003). Veratrum (26-50 species) is the largest genus in tribe Melanthieae (Tamura (1998); Chen & Takahashi
2000; Stevens 2001 onwards; Govaerts 2012). The species inhabit a wide range of habitats and vary
morphologically mainly in characters of habit, leaves, tepals and perigonal nectaries (Zomlefer et al. 2003).
Synapomorphies for Veratrum include dendritic pubescence of the vegetative parts (at least upper stem/
inflorescence) and broadly winged seeds (Zomlefer 1997; Zomlefer et al. 2003).
Initial revisionary work by the first author on Veratrum for the Flora of Thailand indicated two species:
Veratrum chiengdaoense Larsen (1961: 346), a narrow endemic from Doi Chiangdao (Chiang Mai province)
in northwestern Thailand (Larsen 1961) and Veratrum mengtzeanum Loesner (1926: 145), native to the
southwestern Chinese provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan and disjunct to the Doi Phu Wae mountain
in Doi Phu Kha National Park (Nan province), Thailand. Tanaka (2001) suggested these two species may be
conspecific. The World Checklist (Govaerts 2012) has recognised them as separate species. Additionally, the
restricted distribution of V. chiengdaoense raises conservation concerns. Confirmation of conspecificity with
V. mengtzeanum would suggest a wider distribution and revised conservation status. We thus conducted a
morphological study to clarify the taxonomic status of these two taxa.

Materials & Methods
A subset of 11 specimens including the types for each taxon was fully examined. These specimens were
selected to represent V. chiengdaoense and V. mengtzeanum and geographical areas (Thailand and China).
Additional specimens were also examined for the descriptions.
Floral dissections and measurements were made using a Leica M3Z microscope with a calibrated
eyepiece. Vegetative and inflorescence characters were measured with a digital caliper. Measurements were

taken of the largest and smallest exemplar for each organ and 7–10 exemplars of these organs of each
specimen to establish the range. Measurements also indicate the widest point of an organ. Mean values and
standard deviation were calculated and plotted on bar graphs (Fig. 1). Absolute numbers were plotted when
characters or specimens with only one measurement were available (i.e. number of flowers per individual).

Results
Results are shown in Figure 1. Specimens of Thai V. mengtzeanum (dark grey bars) have shorter filaments and
pedicels, particularly in male flowers, and a greater number of flowers per individual than those in the rest of
its range. A limited number of specimens had gynoecia, and results show that the specimen of V.
mengtzeanum from Thailand (Srisanga 2128) has shorter ovaries (generally by at least 1 mm). According to
morphology, specimens of V. chiengdaoense (white bars) and Chinese V. mengtzeanum (light grey bars)
represent a single entity.

Discussion
Morphological characters, especially pedicel length and number of flowers per individual, support two
taxonomic entities. Most other characters overlap, for example, vegetative characters (Fig. 1). Flowers of Thai
V. mengtzeanum specimens have shorter filaments, and inflorescences have a greater number of flowers per
individual (Fig. 1: dark grey bars), along with a disjunct geographical distribution (Fig 2: star) support this
entity as a subspecies. An increase in flower number per individual and reduced length of certain flower parts
might suggest an adaptation to a specific suite of pollinators (Fenster et al. 2004). Further research is
necessary to clarify potential speciation processes in these taxa.
With the limited number of specimens available, it is not known whether the range (Fig. 2) is continuous
through Lao People's Democratic Republic and Burma or if the known populations (in China and Thailand)
are disjunct. Such gaps in distribution may be the result of a number of factors, including habitat
fragmentation, extinction events, environmental changes and dispersal pathways. Alternatively, distribution
gaps may be an artefact of insufficient collecting in intervening areas. Further discussion on how this
disjunction affects conservation status of these taxa can be found below .

Nomenclature notes.—Zimmerman (1958) suggested the syntype “Henry 9979 pro parte” as the
lectotype of V. mengtzeanum. However, this was not effectively published according to Article 30.7 of the
Melbourne Code (McNeill et al. 2012), and lectotypification is effected here.

Conservation Assessment.—There are at least 13 populations of V. mengtzeanum subsp. mengtzeanum
represented by 22 herbarium specimens (Fig. 2). Additional herbarium specimens have been observed within
the same provinces as the georeferenced specimens used in the assessment, but it has been impossible to
determine their exact localities. Using GeoCAT (Bachman et al. 2011; http://geocat.kew.org/), extent of
occurrence (EOO) was calculated to be as 287,500 km2 and area of occupancy (AOO) 48 km2 based on a user
defined cell width of 2 km. Chinese collections are generally old (1882 – 1939), and the most recent one was
collected in 1973. No recent observations have been recorded, and the current status of these populations is
unknown. Thai collections are more recent and have all been collected from Doi Chiangdao, where we also
collected a specimen in 2011. There is a disjunction between Chinese and Thai populations. This species may
occur in intermediate localities in Lao People's Democratic Republic and Burma. Additionally, a member of
the editorial board (Mark Newman, pers. comm.) of the Flore du Cambodge, Laos et Viêtnam confirmed that
this taxon has not been recorded for these countries. With an AOO of 48 km2 this taxon could meet criterion
B2 under Endangered. Until current Chinese populations are assessed, the data available do not suggest
immediate threats to this taxon; its habitat is restricted to relatively high and inaccessible elevations (1,200–
4,000 m), and it has a wide distribution (high EOO). These factors support a preliminary global assessment of
Least Concern, based on the criteria of IUCN (2001).
One population of V. mengtzeanum subsp. mengtzeanum, represented by seven herbarium specimens,
occurs in Thailand (Fig. 2). Using GeoCAT (Bachman et al. 2011; http://geocat.kew.org/), the AOO was
calculated as 8 km2 based on a user defined cell width of 2 km2 and the EOO could not be calculated. Absence

of populations between China and Thailand suggests that the Thai populations may be genetically isolated.
The regional assessment of this subspecies follows the reasoning as for the global assessment of V.
mengtzeanum subsp. phuwae (see below). A preliminary assessment of Near Threatened (NT), based on the
criteria of IUCN (2001), is indicated.

Differs from V. mengtzeanum subsp. mengtzeanum in having a larger number of flowers per individual and shorter
filaments.

Holotype:—THAILAND. Doi Phu Wae, Doi Phu Kha National Park, Chalerm Pra Kiat, 1700 m, 5 September
2001, Srisanga 2128 (QBG!).
Inflorescence with 155-226 flowers. Filaments 1.2–2.9 mm long.
Distribution.—Northern Thailand (Nan).
Ecology.—1700–1800 m elev. Flowering and fruiting from September to January.
Etymology.— This subspecies is named after the Phu Wae mountain peak located in Doi Phu Ka National
Park in the northern floristic region of Nan in Thailand, the only known locality. The specific ephithet
“phuwae” is a noun in apposition and therefore does not have an additional Latin suffix.
Specimens examined.—THAILAND. Nan: Doi Phu Kha National Park, Phu Wae. 1800 m, 4 July 1999,

Chalerm Pra Kiat, 1700 m, 5 September 2001, Srisanga 2128 (QBG).
Conservation Assessment.—The one population of V. mengtzeanum subsp. phuwae is represented by four
herbarium specimens (Fig. 2). Using GeoCAT (Bachman et al. 2011; http://geocat.kew.org/), the AOO was

calculated as 4 km2 based on a user defined cell width of 2 km2, which suggests this taxon meets criterion B2
under Critically Endangered. The specimens only had general locality information, and thus georeferencing
was imprecise; the EOO could not be calculated. It is likely that more individuals could be found in suitable
habitats in nearby areas, in which case the EOO might increase to over 100 km2, and this taxon might then be
classed as Endangered. Even though specimens show that this population is still extant, it is strictly restricted
to limestone outcrops, resulting in a fragmented distribution. Limestone habitats are generally threatened in
Thailand by extraction for making concrete (Wilkin et al. 2012), but this population (IUCN locations) is in a
National Park; thus, it is afforded a higher level of protection. This taxon meets some conditions for CR B1+2a
and VU D2, but there are no observed declines or extreme fluctuations. However, the taxon needs to be
carefully monitored in Thailand as the introduction of a threat of any kind would have an impact. A
preliminary assessment of Near Threatened (NT), based on the criteria of IUCN (2001), is indicated.
