Abstract
The diversity of the lichen family Cladoniaceae in the Neotropics is apparently underestimated. A revision of the family
for the Flora of the Guianas resulted in the description of 10 species new to science from Northern South America:
Cladonia cayennensis; Cladonia flavocrispata; Cladonia isidiifera; Cladonia maasii; Cladonia mollis; Cladonia
persphacelata; Cladonia recta; Cladonia rupununii; Cladonia subsphacelata; Cladonia termitarum.
Key words: new species, endemic species, Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, Guyana Highland

Introduction
The lichen family Cladoniaceae is studied by us for the Flora of the Guianas (Ahti & Sipman 2013, in press).
The area covered by our treatment includes Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana and, because this area
shares most of the species, also the Venezuelan Guayana with its tepuis. In this way we got a good coverage
for the whole Guiana Shield, well-known as one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world. Both of us were
able to study most species ourselves in situ, during field work in Guyana and Venezuela, HS also in French
Guiana, on several expeditions.
The treatment is based on the recent monograph of Cladoniaceae of the whole Neotropics (Ahti 2000).
However, we were astonished to encounter no less then ten undescribed species in the area. Indeed, a few of
them were recognized earlier but due to sparse or poor material they were not published. The new species
recognized during our study are described separately here.

Material and methods
About 900 specimens from the study area were examined, collected by us during several expeditions or
obtained on loan mainly from the herbaria B, H, NY and US. For morphological character analysis air-dried
specimens were observed under the stereomicroscope. Anatomical details were studied by compound
microscope. The chemistry was analysed by standard TLC (Orange, James & White 2001).

Cladonia cayennensis Ahti & Sipman, sp. nov. (Fig. 1)
Mycobank # MB 803520
Thallus primarius squamulosus, viridifuscus, rotundatus, squamulae 1–2 mm latae, infra sorediosae. Conidiomata et
apothecia ignota. Acidum usnicum (parce) et zeorinam (crystallis numerosis in speciminibus diu conservatis)

Type:—FRENCH GUIANA. Cayenne: Botanical Garden, on palm, sea level, 04º56’N, 52º20’W, Mar 1985, A. Aptroot
15098 (holotype L!, isotypes B!, H!).

Primary thallus persistent, consisting of flat to concave, even involute squamules, 1–2 mm wide, soft and
fragile, with rounded lobes, entire or little divided; upper side greenish-brown, lower side white, floccose and
loosely sorediate, specially along margins; occasionally squamules provided with short basal, brownishveined stalk. Podetia, conidiomata and hymenial discs unknown. Chemistry: usnic acid (in low concentration)
and zeorin (needle-like crystals abundant on old herbarium specimens!). Colour reactions: P–, K–, KC–.

FIGURE 1. Cladonia cayennensis, holotype. Bar = 1 cm.

Distribution and ecology:—Known so far only from the Guianas, but in view of its occurrence in
secondary habitats, the species is probably more widespread. Perhaps it was once reported as C. ahtii S.
Stenroos (1989: 252) from adjacent Venezuela, in Bolívar near Canaima, epiphytic at 550 m elev.; this record
was excluded from C. ahtii by Ahti (2000). The species was found exclusively epiphytic on hepatic film on
smooth, living palm stems in plantations along the coast.

Additional specimen examined (paratype):—SURINAME. Paramaribo: Palmgarden, sea level, Aptroot
14829 (L!).
Remarks:—Cladonia cayennensis is a sorediate representative of the group of Cladonia miniata G.
Meyer (1825: 149), similar to C. ahtii, from which it differs by the thinner thallus lobes and different
chemistry (Ahti 2000). It is also close to C. meridionalis Vainio in Zahlbruckner (1909: 136), but that species
has much larger thallus lobes, which are sorediate over much of their lower side. Cladonia termitorum (see
below) is also rather similar, due to its slightly sorediate thallus lobes. It differs by its thinner and more finely
divided squamules, its chemistry and the regular presence of small podetia and red hymenial discs.
In the absence of apothecia and podetia its systematic position is tentative. It is based on the similarity of its
thallus squamules with the miniata group of the genus Cladonia, and its chemistry which occurs in Cladonia
rather than in other squamulose lichen genera. Cladonia cayennensis is easily overlooked because it is known
only in squamulose, sterile state. However, having a distinct morphology and chemistry, it cannot be any other
species of Cladonia recognized by Ahti (2000) in tropical America. Herbarium specimens are easily identified
by the soredia and abundant zeorin crystals on the lower surface of the squamules (crystals expected to be
absent from fresh material). The presence of a low amount of usnic acid causes hardly any yellowish colour.

Primary thallus evanescent, pale green, restricted to scattered, small squamules in the lower part of the
podetia, ca. 0.2–0.5 × 1 mm, simple or somewhat split up irregularly into crenulate laciniae, esorediate.
Podetia 5–12 cm tall, of indeterminate growth, pale greenish grey, in lower parts strongly variegated, with
alternating pale greenish grey and brown to black patches, usually forming cushions composed of dense,
erect, 1.0–1.5 mm wide main stems; stereome soon brownish but not blackening inside; branching type
anisotomous tricho- to polytomy; axils always perforated and only slightly swollen; branchlet tips short and
darkbrown, usually under 0.5 mm long. Podetial surface matt, discontinuously very thinly corticate,with most
of the stereome becoming bare with age, usually esquamose but some squamules may occur, particularly in
fallen podetia; podetial squamules up to ca. 1.5 mm wide, divided in ca. 0.5 mm wide, elongate and crenulate
lobes. Podetial wall 125–175(–200) µ m thick, cortex 0–35 µ m; medulla mostly absent; stereome 125–
150 µm, pellucid, well-delimited. Conidiomata and hymenial discs not observed. Chemistry: thamnolic and
usnic acids, sometimes with barbatic acid (TLC of 3 specimens). Colour reactions: P+ yellow, K+ yellow,
KC+ yellow.
Distribution and ecology:—The available samples suggest that this is a Guayana Highlands endemic,
known so far with certainty only from Venezuela. It is found in humid sandstone tableland, and it grows on
sandstone flats with open bog vegetation between ca. (400–)1000 and 2500 m elev. From the Guianas only
three doubtful collections are known, from the sandstone plateau of the Kaieteur Falls (see notes).
Additional specimens examined (paratypes):—VENEZUELA. Amazonas, Depto. Atabapo: Cerro
Marahuaca, Cumbre, 2480–2580 m, 1982, M. Guariglia et al. 1512 (H!, VEN!); Bolívar: Chimantá, Toronotepui, 2100 m, 1985, Ahti et al. 45255 (H!, VEN!); Chimantá, 2130 m, Vareschi 9209 (H!, VEN!);
Auyantepuí-Massif, Guayaraca, 1100 m, 1956, Vareschi & Foldats 6303 (H!, VEN!); Cerro Guaiquinima,
1000 m, 1990, Sipman 26514 (B!, H!, VEN!); id., 1500 m, 1990, Sipman 27101, 27105 (B, H, VEN).
Remarks:—Cladonia flavocrispata is very similar to C. hians Ahti (2000: 284) and could be considered
its usnic acid-strain. However, it is also larger in size. Like C. hians, it belongs in section Perviae, as
demonstrated by the regular perforations of the axils. The species can be also easily confused with C.
vareschii Ahti (1986: 218). The latter has a more intense yellow tinge and its cortex is somewhat thicker. Its
apical branchlets stand at an obtuse angle (>90°) and bend away from each other immediately. A very reliable
difference is the (often scarce) presence of squamules in C. flavocrispata.
Three Guianas specimens (GUYANA, Potaro-Siparuni Region, Kaieteur Falls National Park, around the
airstrip, ca. 400 m elev., Sipman 40299, 40300, 40336 (B!, BRG!)) show a considerable resemblance, but
deviate by the mostly closed axils not developing into funnels and the complete absence of squamules. In this
repect they agree more with C. vareschii but lack the obtuse-angled apical branchlets and brownish colour.
They may be more close to C. spinea Ahti (1986: 215), which lacks main stems, however.

Cladonia isidiifera Ahti & Sipman, sp. nov. (Fig. 3)
Mycobank #MB 803522

virgin, riverine forest, on overhanging tree along river, ca. 550 m elev., 11 Feb. 1985, H. Sipman & A. Aptroot 18671
(holotype B!).

Primary thallus persistent, consisting of 1–4 mm long, horizontal to ascending squamules which are deeply
divided in ca. 0.5–1.0 mm wide and ca. 0.3 mm thick, slightly crenulate lobes, with flat to concave, green
upper side and white or pale brown, shiny lower side, with pale hypothallus, often isidiate along the tips of
erect, up to 5 mm long and 2 mm wide extensions of the lobes; isidia short-cylindrical, ca. 0.3 mm long and
0.15 mm wide, glossy. Podetia, conidiomata and hymenial discs not known. Chemistry: barbatic and 4-Odemethylbarbatic (minor) acids. Colour reactions: P–, K–, KC–.

FIGURE 3. Cladonia isidiifera, holotype. Bar = 1 cm.

Distribution and ecology:—Known only from a single specimen found in the Upper Mazaruni Distr.,
Guyana, on an overhanging trunk along a stream at ca. 550 m elev. in mossy forest.
Additional specimens examined:—known from the type only.
Remarks:—The presence of cylindrical isidia is so unusual in the genus Cladonia, that there is no doubt
that the only available specimen belongs to an undescribed species. The thallus squamules show that it is
related to C. miniata. Morphologically it bears most similarity with C. ahtii. This species is sorediate instead
of isidiate, and it lacks the peculiar lobe extensions. In the C. miniata-group there is one more isidiate species,
C. caribaea S. Stenroos (1989: 256). This has coralloid to flattened, not cylindrical isidia.

Primary thallus squamulose, evanescent, squamules ca. 0.1 mm diam. Podetia 4–6(–10) cm tall, 0.3–1 mm
thick, rarely with scattered, small squamules, of indeterminate growth, basic colour whitish grey but exposed
parts may become dark brown, forming erect, dense, flat, interwoven mats; branching type anisotomous

dichotomy, to a lesser degree trichotomy or tetrachotomy; main stems in part distinguishable; axils commonly
perforated; tips erect, divaricate, acute. Podetial surface clearly corticate; cortex smooth to somewhat
rugulose, dull, with some ecorticate patches; soredia and squamules lacking. Podetial wall thin, ca. 100–
200 µm; cortex 50 µm; medulla 50–100 µm; stereome ca. 100 µm. Hymenial discs not seen. Conidiomata
scarce, at the end of podetia, 200–300 × 100–150 µm, ovoid to ampullaceous, constricted at base, black,
content not seen. Chemistry: fumarprotocetraric, tr. protocetraric, homosekikaic and/or sekikaic acids. Colour
reactions: P+ red, K–, KC–.

FIGURE 4. Cladonia maasii, holotype. Bar = 2 cm.

Distribution and ecology:—A Guianan endemic, as far as presently known, represented only by two
collections from Suriname and one from Guyana, in shrub savanna, from ca. 200 to 1000 m elev.
Aditional specimens examined (paratypes):—GUYANA. Ituru Yawaruki savanna, white sand areas,
Abraham 123 (BM!) (TLC (F. Oberli, G): with fumarprotocetraric, protocetraric, homosekikaic, and sekikaic
acid). SURINAME. Natuurreservaat Brinckheuvel, Sabanpasi savanne complex, Teunissen & Wildschut LBB
11403 (L!).
Remarks:—Cladonia maasii is named in honour of the collector, Prof. Dr. Paul J.M. Maas, who
discovered several important Cladonia sites in the Guianas. The lichen resembles C. peltastica (Nylander
1874: 70) Müller Argoviensis (1880: 260) but contains fumarprotocetraric acid and tends to get slightly brown
and has no usnic acid. Its branchlets are also more robust, with perforated axils, and the ramification is less
dense than in C. peltastica. A specimen from Guyana (Mt. Latipu near Kamarang, Sipman & Aptroot 19164,
B!) is included here with doubt. It agrees in chemistry but the podetia are more slender.

Type:—GUYANA. Demerara-Mahaica Region: on Linden Highway, km 7 from Soesdyke, by end of trail to Marudi
Creek Resort, 06º31’N, 58º12’W, 10 m elev., on burnt stump in secondary woodland with savanna patches on white
sand, 1996, T. Ahti, R. Lücking & H. Sipman 52910 (holotype BRG!, isotypes B!, H!, US!, VEN!).

Primary thallus squamulose, consisting of green, flattish squamules with convex lobes and necrotic bases
turning orange. Podetia 1–2(–3) cm tall, of determinate growth, whitish to greenish yellow, always forming
scyphi; scyphi 1–4 mm wide, usually single but with age proliferating from the margins and sometimes
forming a second scyphus at the end of the proliferations, just below the short-stalked apothecia. Podetial
surface totally ecorticate or little corticate at the very base, otherwise very rough due to coarse granules and
often very densely beset with microsquamules, all of which dissolve into a thick layer of loose, finely
granulose soredia towards the tops. Podetial wall not measured. Conidiomata formed on margins of young
scyphi, typically black, cylindrical, shortly stipitate; with purple slime inside. Hymenial discs unusual, at
margins of scyphi, forming 1–2 mm wide purple disks. Chemistry: K+ yellow, PD+ yellow, containing usnic
and thamnolic acids, as well as the purple pigment rhodocladonic acid in hymenial discs and conidiomata.

FIGURE 5. Cladonia mollis, isotype (B). Bar = 2 cm.

Distribution and ecology:—Cladonia mollis is known from the Guianas and northern Brazil, but is
expected to be more widespread in Amazonia. It was observed on rotten wood and white sand in forest
clearings and savannas, from 10 to 500 m elev.

(H!, INPA, NY!).
Remarks:—The species is distinguished from the very similar C. corallifera (Kunze 1827-1828)
Nylander (1874: 70) by the production of distinct soredia almost throughout the surface of the podetia.
However, it may be difficult to distinguish from granulose morphs of C. corallifera. In Guiana we
encountered the two species growing together in some places, where they appeared to be distinct. Also E. A.

Vainio recognized the species under an unpublished herbarium name (see above). All the specimens of C.
mollis that were chemically studied contained thamnolic acid, while in C. corallifera the chemistry is more
variable (Ahti 2000).
Cladonia mollis is also closely related to C. prancei Ahti (2000: 223), another sorediate derivative of C.
corallifera, which in addition has podetia forming narrow scyphi, sometimes becoming subulate, with a low
content of usnic acid often giving the podetia a pale grey colour without yellowish tinge.
Sorediate squamules have been found only in the specimen Sipman & Aptroot 18538.

into ca. 0.5 mm wide, elongate laciniae, attenuated and often almost stalk-like at the base, on the lower side
with rather smooth surface to corticoid and sometimes with ochraceous streak. Podetia up to 5 cm tall and
0.5–1.5 mm thick, of determinate growth, grey to usually more or less brown, in lower part almost black,
horny and swollen, somewhat branched; branching type irregular anisotomous dichotomy, rarely trichotomy
or tetrachotomy; axils closed or with usually small openings; tips often divided into 2–10 short branchlets.
Podetial surface smooth and often shiny, denudated even at the tips, finally being rather densely squamulose,
smooth inbetween, esorediate; mature squamules narrow, laciniate and imbricate, up to 4 mm long, pointing
downward but with recurved tips, often glossy. Podetial wall 200–290 µ m thick; cortex (0–)25–40 µ m,
consisting of large cells; medulla very thin, (0–)10–25 µ m (including the algae); stereome distinctly
delimited, very horny, thick, 200–250 µ m, inner surface glossy. Conidiomata terminal on tiny apical
branchlets, often grouped, 200–250 × 100–150 µm, dolioliform, constricted at the base, shortly pedicellate,
containing red slime. Hymenial discs not seen. Chemistry: thamnolic acid sometimes with a trace of didymic

Remarks:—Cladonia persphacelata belongs to a group of closely related species including in the
Guianas C. polystomata Ahti & Sipman in Ahti (2000) and C. subsphacelata (see below), and the Brazilian C.
sphacelata Vainio (1887: 456). C. polystomata grows on soil or litter and forms wide funnels on top of more

or less corticated, up to ca. 1 cm thick, little branched podetia with short squamules. C. subsphacelata has
largely corticate, less than 1 mm wide podetia, and shares with C. persphacelata the saxicolous habit and very
elongated squamules. C. sphacelata has short podetial squamules, the podetia remain thin, under 1 mm wide,
and do not become horny.
Richly squamulose forms of C. subdelicatula Vainio ex Asahina (1963: 1) can also resemble C.
persphacelata. They differ by their felty rather than smooth surface and their preference for tree bark as
substrate (in the Guianas).

Remarks:—Cladonia recta resembles most C. peltastica, but is much more slender and forms
conspicuous, straight, erect colonies. However, it is possible that it represents an usnic acid-free chemotype of
that species.

Primary thallus persistent, consisting of very small, 0.5–2 mm long, dissected squamules, veined below; often
slightly sorediate along margins. Podetia up to 2 cm tall, 0.3–1 mm thick, of determinate growth, very slender,
whitish grey, dichotomously or digitately branched, especially in upper parts; branchlets divergent; axils
closed; tips bluntish; ascyphose. Podetial surface abundantly farinose-sorediate throughout. Podetial wall
anatomy not studied. Hymenial discs red, not seen in maturity. Conidiomata born on basal squamules or at tips
of podetia, ampullaceous, black, containing purple slime. Chemistry: didymic, barbatic, trace of
demethylbarbatic acids. Colour reactions: P–, K–, KC–.
Distribution and ecology:—A Guyana endemic, so far as known, collected once in a forest island on a
hilltop in the Rupununi savanna in SW Guyana, on rotten log in clearing along a stream, at 450 m elev.
Additional specimens examined:—known from the type only.
Remarks:—Very similar and apparently closely related to Cladonia macilenta Hoffmann (1796: 126),
but more branched. Also similar to Cladonia prancei, which is much more robust, forms narrow scyphi, and
always contains thamnolic acid. Chemically, it is similar to C. didyma (Fée 1825: 118, 101) Vainio (1887:
137), but that species has smooth, pellucid podetia producing granules or squamules and lacks soredia.

Primary thallus persistent, consisting of up to 0.5 cm long squamules which are deeply divided into ca.
0.5 mm wide, elongate laciniae, attenuated and often almost stalk-like at the base, with rather smooth to
corticoid surface towards the base and sometimes with ochraceous streak. Podetia up to 3 cm tall and 0.3–
0.8 mm thick, of determinate growth, grey to usually more or less brown, at base almost black, somewhat
branched; branching type irregular anisotomous dichotomy, rarely trichotomy or tetrachotomy; axils closed or
with usually small openings; tips often divided into 2–10 short branchlets; central canal very thin, ca. 0.1 mm
wide. Podetial surface smooth and mostly corticate, not shiny, finally being rather densely squamulose,
smooth inbetween, esorediate; mature squamules narrow, laciniate and imbricate, up to 4 mm long, pointing
downward but with recurved tips, often glossy. Podetial wall 200–300 µ m thick; cortex (0–)25–40 µ m;
medulla thin, 10–25 µm (including the algae); stereome distinctly delimited, horny, thick, 200–250 µm, inner
surface glossy. Conidiomata not seen. Hymenial discs not seen. Chemistry: squamatic and didymic acids
(TLC of 4 specimens). Colour reactions: P–, K–, KC–; UV+ white.
Distribution and ecology:—Species known so far only from French Guiana and Guyana, found in
sananna over rock from 100 to 400 m elev.
Additional specimens examined (paratypes):—GUYANA. Potaro-Siparuni Region, Kaieteur Falls
National Park, around the airstrip, Sipman 40326 (B!, BRG!); Ahti et al. 53048a (B!, H!, US!); trail to
Johnson's View, dePriest 9375 (H!). FRENCH GUIANA. Savane Roche de Virginie, Bassin de l'Approuague,

Remarks:—For differences with related species see under C. persphacelata.

Cladonia termitarum Ahti, sp. nov. (Fig. 10)
Mycobank # MB 803527
Thallus squamulosus, aggregatus, squamulae minutae (0.3–1 mm longae), crustaceae, crassae, subteretia, marginibus
crenulatis, interdum parce sorediosis. Podetia brevissima (0.5–2 mm), laevia, granulosa vel squamosissima, semper
fertilia. Conidiomata subsphaerica, demum ostiolum hians, gelatinam coccineam continentia. Disci hymeniales
applanati, coccinei. Acidum fumarprotocetraricum et acidum rhodocladonicum continens.
Type:—GUYANA. Potaro-Siparuni Region: Kaieteur Falls National Park, S side of airstrip, 0.5º10’N, 59º29’W, 400 m
elev., on termite structure on premontane sclerophyll forest floor, 1996, T. Ahti et al. 53023 (holotype BRG!,
isotypes B!, H!, US!).

Primary thallus persistent, appearing crustose but consisting of 0.3–1 mm long, 0.1–0.5 mm wide, pale
greenish to brownish grey squamules, usually very short and irregular, convex, thick, often warty or almost
cylindrical, often densely aggregated, crenulate at ends and margins, with eroded, granulose patches
extending on the underside of the squamules; necrotic basal parts becoming orange. Podetia often numerous,
very short (0.5–2 mm), of determinate growth, greenish grey; stalk smooth (little corticate), granulose or
densely squamulose. Podetial surface areolate-verruculose. Podetial wall not measured. Conidiomata
scattered, subspherical, black, 0.2 mm tall, after ejaculation of conidia ostiolum gaping open with black,
toothed margins and red slime visible inside. Hymenial discs sparsely produced, on very short (0.5–2 mm),
smooth, granulose or squamulose podetia, flat, purple. Chemistry: PD+ fast brick red, containing the
fumarprotocetraric acid complex; the purple pigment rhodocladonic acid in hymenial discs and conidiomata.
Distribution and ecology:—A Guianas endemic, known so far only from three collections made near the
Kaieteur Falls, Guyana. It was exclusively observed on old forest floor termite structures, at ca. 400 m elev.
These structures are very common in the Amazonian and associated lowland rainforests, therefore the species
is expected to be more widespread.
Additional specimens examined (paratypes):—GUYANA. Potaro-Siparuni Region, type locality,
termite mound, Ahti 53020 (BRG!, H!, US!); Kaieteur Falls National Park, N side of airstrip, termite mound,
Ahti 53035 (B!, BRG!, H!).

FIGURE 10. Cladonia termitarum, isotype (B). Bar = 1 cm.

Remarks:—The short-stalked, bright red ascomata in combination with the presence of
fumarprotocetraric acid set this species well apart from all Guianas lichens. The only similar species is
Cladonia ahtii Stenroos, known from SE Brazil, which belongs to the group of C. miniata, and differs by the
shape of the squamules, thick and rounded, with a flat to concave upper surface.
