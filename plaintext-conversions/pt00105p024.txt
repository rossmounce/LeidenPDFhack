Introduction
Bomarea Mirbel (1804: 71; Alstroemeriaceae) includes 122 species (Govaerts 2013) and is divided into four
subgenera (Hofreiter & Tillich 2002): Baccata (five species), Bomarea (ca. seventy species), Sphaerine
(twelve species) and Wichuraea (eighteen species). Bomarea is distributed from Mexico and the Greater
Antilles to southern South America (Gereau 1994). The centre of distribution of the genus is along the Andes
from Colombia to Bolivia (Hofreiter 2008).
The diversity of Bomarea species scientifically documented for Panama has not increased in the last two
decades: from five species (two endemic) in the Flora of Panama of Woodson, Schery and collaborators
(Killip 1945) to 12 species (four endemic) in Flora Mesoamericana (Gereau 1994) and 12 species (four
endemic) in the recent Catálogo de plantas vasculares de Panamá (Correa et al. 2004). After the recent
treatment of Bomarea subgen. Bomarea sect. Multiflorae by Hofreiter (2008), this number decreased to 11
species: Bomarea acuminata Baker (1887: 212) is a synonym of B. andreana Baker (1882: 205), and B.
caldasii (Kunth, 1816: 283) Ascherson & Graebner (1906: 431) is synonymous with B. multiflora (Linneaus
f., 1782: 207) Mirbel (1804: 72), but B. costaricensis Kränzlin (1913: 4) is newly reported for Panama. Of
these 11 species, four are endemic to Panama and Costa Rica, and only B. caudatisepala Gereau (1989: 599)
and B. bracteolata Gereau (1989: 601) are endemic to Panama (Hofreiter 2008).
No new taxa of Bomarea have been described from Panama since Gereau (1989). However, some areas of
the country have not been sufficiently collected because difficult orography and landscape, principally in far
western (Cordillera de Talamanca) and far eastern Panama.
During a botanical excursion made in 2006, a specimen of Bomarea from a cloud forest was collected in
the Reserva Forestal Fortuna (Cordillera de Talamanca) in Chiriqui Province. Subsequently, herbarium
collections of Bomarea from 12 herbaria (B, CR, FR, INB, MO, NY, PMA, SCZ, SEL, UCH, USJ and WU;
abbreviations from Thiers 2013) were studied. The specimen did not match any of the known taxa of the
genus and hence is described and illustrated here as a new species.
Bomarea rinconii Cáceres González, sp. nov. (Fig. 1)
Type:—PANAMA. Chiriqui Prov.: Distr. Gualaca, Reserva Forestal Fortuna, cloud forest, elevation 1800 m, 8° 46'
12.54" N, 82° 11' 44.02" W, 4 April 2006, Cáceres González 2988 (holotype: UCH!; isotypes: UCH!, PMA!).
This new species is similar to Bomarea caudatisepala, but it is characterized by leaves that are 2.6–3.0 times longer than
wide (ovate or ovate-lanceolate), involucral bracts that are generally trifid and equal in length, every sepal having a short
horn (1.0–1.5 mm long) located 1–2 mm below the apex, inner tepals (4.6–4.9 cm long), stigma trifid (every lobule 2.5–
3.0 mm long), whereas B. caudatisepala has a horn, but it is longer (7–10 mm long) and located 2–4 mm below the apex,
and the involucral bracts are entire.

Plant twining, stem slender up to 3 m long, 3.5–4.0 mm in diameter, glabrous. Leaves ovate or ovatelanceolate, 7.8–11.0 × 5–6 cm, from 1.5–2.1 times longer than wide. Both leaf surfaces glabrous, acuminate
apex; petiole 1.4–1.8 cm long, glabrous. Involucral bracts 5, glabrous, generally trifid, 1.3–1.9 × 0.25 cm at
base and 0.70 cm at apex, lobules 1–2 mm long. Inflorescence an umbel, pedicels up to 6, unbranched,
ebracteolate 15.7–20.0 cm long, pubescent with short scattered hairs (erect to slightly curved), 0.1–0.2 mm
long, brown. Flowers actinomorphic, calyx with glandular pubescence, 0.01–0.05 mm long and yellowish;
outer tepals 3, free, 4.4–4.6 × 0.4–0.5 cm at base to 1.1–1.3 cm at apex, dark orange to reddish orange
abaxially and orange-yellowish adaxially, every sepal with a short horn 1.0–1.5 mm long located 1–2 mm
below the apex, green to blackish; inner tepals 3, free, unguiculate, 4.6–4.9 cm long (up to 2–5 mm longer
than sepals), 1.4–1.7 mm wide at base to 2.1 cm wide on the apex, which is retuse-mucronate to lightly
rounded, orange yellowish abaxially, yellowish adaxially in the lower half and orange at the apex, mottled
purple-brown on the upper two-thirds. Stamens 6, free, filaments 3.0–4.5 cm long, straight, shorter than

Etymology:—Bomarea rinconii is named in honour of Prof. Rafael Rincón Gómez (1947–), from the
Escuela de Biología in the Universidad Autónoma de Chiriquí (UNACHI), who is considered one of the most
knowledgeable contemporary botanists of western Panama. He contributed vastly to the collections of the
UCH herbarium and is highly esteemed for his generous nature of sharing his knowledge with colleagues and
students. During his career, he has been a man with a great passion for botany and insatiable curiosity about
the vascular plants of Panama; he has played an important role in the education of many professionals at
University of Panama and now at UNACHI.
Distribution:—Bomarea rinconii is so far only known from the Reserva Forestal Fortuna, Chiriqui
Province, in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Panama.
Habitat and Ecology:—The new species grows in primary cloud forest at an elevation around 1800 m.
The common associates are Guzmania scandens H.E.Luther & W.J.Kress (Bromeliaceae), Sobralia species
(Orchidaceae), Anthurium species (Araceae), Satyria species (Ericaceae). It was observed flowering from
April to May (end of the dry season).
Conservation status:—Bomarea rinconii has been collected only once in Panama. At this site, few
individuals have been observed, and, hence, it is assumed to be rare. However, only few areas on the Reserva
Forestal Fortuna have been explored, and there are many endemic species of plants in this protected area.
Therefore, in the conservation assessment presented here (following the guidelines of the IUCN 2001),
Bomarea rinconii is categorized as Critically Endangered (CR), represented by only two distribution records
and based on the criteria B2bi–ii.
Discussion:—Bomarea rinconii belongs to the former section Caldasianae with inner tepals exceeding
outer and inflorescence an umbel (Killip 1935), but this section is now included in section Multiflorae
(Hofreiter 2008). In Panama, section Multiflorae, according to Hofreiter (2008), is represented by seven
species: Bomarea acutifolia (Link & Otto, 1828: 57) Herbert (1837: 112), B. andreana, B. caudatisepala, B.
costaricensis, B. chiriquina Killip (1945: 15), B. hirsuta (Kunth, 1816: 285) Herbert (1837: 114) and B.
suberecta Gereau (1989: 599). Four of the seven species are similar to B. rinconii (B. caudatisepala, B.
suberecta, B. andreana and B. costaricensis).
In Bomarea rinconii every sepal has a short horn 1.0–1.5 mm long, located 1–2 mm below the apex. A
horn is also present in B. caudatisepala, but it is longer, 7–10 mm, and located 2–4 mm below the apex.
Another important feature is that in B. rinconii the involucral bracts are trifid, whereas in B. caudatisepala
they are entire. Leaves in B. rinconii (5–6 cm) are wider than in B. caudatisepala (2.7–4.5), from 1.5 to 2.1
times longer than wide in the former and 2.6 to 3.0 times longer than wide in the latter.
Lobules of the trifid involucral bracts are equal in length in Bomarea rinconii, but in B. suberecta the
middle (central) lobe is longer than the outer (lateral) ones, as is evident from the holotype (D'Arcy 6587,
MO!). In B. rinconii one of the involucral bracts is leaf-like, and in B. suberecta all involucral bracts are
BOMAREA RINCONII SP. NOV.

equal. Bomarea rinconii has a twining habit, whereas B. suberecta is suberect to erect. Bomarea rinconii can
be easily distinguished from B. andreana and B. costaricensis by the open inflorescence. Bomarea rinconii
has a short horn, which is not present at all in B. costaricensis and B. andreana.
